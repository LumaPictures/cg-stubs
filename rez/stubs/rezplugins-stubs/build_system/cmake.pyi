    """The CMake build system.

    The 'cmake' executable is run within the build environment. Rez supplies a
    library of cmake macros in the 'cmake_files' directory; these are added to
    cmake's searchpath and are available to use in your own CMakeLists.txt
    file.

    The following CMake variables are available:
    - REZ_BUILD_TYPE: One of 'local', 'central'. Describes whether an install
      is going to the local packages path, or the release packages path.
    - REZ_BUILD_INSTALL: One of 0 or 1. If 1, an installation is taking place;
      if 0, just a build is occurring.
