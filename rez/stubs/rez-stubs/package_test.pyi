class PackageTestRunner:
    '''Object for running a package\'s tests.

    This runs the tests listed in the package\'s "tests" attribute.

    An example tests entry in a package.py might look like this:

    .. code-block:: python

       tests = {
           "unit": "python -m unittest -s {root}/tests",
           "CI": {
               "command": "python {root}/ci_tests/main.py",
               "requires": ["maya-2017"],
               "replace": True
           }
       }

    By default tests are run in an environment containing the current package.

    If a test entry is just a string, then it is treated as the test
    command. If a dict, the "command" string is the command, and the "requires"
    list is added to the test env.

    Command strings automatically expand references such as ``{root}``, much
    as happens in a :data:`commands` function.

    Commands can also be a list - in this case, the test process is launched
    directly, rather than interpreted via a shell.
