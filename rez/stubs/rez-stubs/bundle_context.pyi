    """Bundle a context and its variants into a relocatable dir.

    This creates a copy of a context with its variants retargeted to a local
    package repository containing only the variants the context uses. The
    generated file structure looks like so::

        /dest_dir/
            /context.rxt
            /packages/
                /foo/1.1.1/package.py

                /bah/4.5.6/package.py
                          /...(payload)...

    Args:
        context (`ResolvedContext`): Context to bundle
        dest_dir (str): Destination directory. Must not exist.
        force (bool): If True, relocate package even if non-relocatable. Use at
            your own risk. Overrides `skip_non_relocatable`.
        skip_non_relocatable (bool): If True, leave non-relocatable packages
            unchanged. Normally this will raise a `PackageCopyError`.
        quiet (bool): Suppress all output
        patch_libs (bool): If True, modify libs and executables within the
            bundle to patch any references to external packages back to their
            equivalents within the bundle. See
            https://rez.readthedocs.io/en/stable/context_bundles.html#patching-libraries
            for more details on this.
        verbose (bool): Verbose mode (quiet will override)
