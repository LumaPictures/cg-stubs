    Example:

        >>> def make_root(variant, path):

        >>>

        >>>     pkg.description = \'does foo things\'
        >>>     pkg.requires = [\'python-2.7\']

    Args:
        name (str): Package name.
        path (str): Package repository path to install package into.
        make_base (typing.Callable): Function that is used to create the package
            payload, if applicable.
        make_root (typing.Callable): Function that is used to create the package
            variant payloads, if applicable.
        skip_existing (bool): If True, detect if a variant already exists, and
            skip with a warning message if so.
        warn_on_skip (bool): If True, print warning when a variant is skipped.

    Yields:
        `PackageMaker` object.

    Note:
        Both `make_base` and `make_root` are called once per variant install,
        and have the signature (variant, path).

    Note:
        The \'installed_variants\' attribute on the `PackageMaker` instance will
        be appended with variant(s) created by this function, if any.
