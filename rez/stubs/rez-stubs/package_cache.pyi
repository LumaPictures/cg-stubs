class PackageCache:
    """Package cache.

    A package cache is responsible for storing copies of variant payloads into a
    location that would typically be on local disk. The intent is to avoid
    fetching a package's files over shared storage at runtime.

    A package cache is used like so:

    * A rez-env is performed;
    * The context is resolved;
    * For each variant in the context, we check to see if it's present in the current package cache;
    * If it is, the variant's root is remapped to this location.

    A package cache is **not** a package repository. It just stores copies of
    variant payloads - no package definitions are stored.

    Payloads are stored into the following structure::

        /<cache_dir>/foo/1.0.0/af8d/a/<payload>
                                   /a.json

    Here, 'af8d' is the first 4 chars of the SHA1 hash of the variant's 'handle',
    which is a dict of fields that uniquely identify the variant. To avoid
    hash collisions, the variant is then stored under a subdir that is incrementally
    named ('a', 'b', ..., 'aa', 'ab', ...). The 'a.json' file is used to find the
    correct variant within the hash subdir. The intent is to keep cached paths
    short, and avoid having to search too many variant.json files to find the
    matching variant.

        The following steps are taken to ensure muti-thread/proc safety, and to
        guarantee that a partially-copied variant payload is never able to be
        used:

        1. The hash dir (eg '/<cache_dir>/foo/1.0.0/af8d') is created;
        2. A file lock mutex ('/<cache_dir>/.lock') is acquired;
        3. The file '/<cache_dir>/foo/1.0.0/af8d/.copying-a' (or -b, -c etc) is
           created. This tells rez that this variant is being copied and cannot
           be used yet;
        4. The file '/<cache_dir>/foo/1.0.0/af8d/a.json' is created. Now
           another proc/thread can't create the same local variant;
        5. The file lock is released;
        6. The variant payload is copied to '/<cache_dir>/foo/1.0.0/af8d/a';
        7. The '.copying-a' file is removed.

        Note that the variant will not be cached in the following circumstances,
        unless `force` is True:

        - The variant is not cachable as determined by `Variant.is_cachable`;
        - The variant is from a local package, and 'config.package_cache_local'
          is False;
        - The variant is stored on the same disk device as this cache, and
          config.package_cache_same_device' is False.

            variant (Variant): The variant to copy into this cache
            force (bool): Copy the variant regardless. Use at your own risk (there

            wait_for_copying (bool): Whether the caching step should block when one of the
