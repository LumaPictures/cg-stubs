    '''memcached memoization function decorator.

    The wrapped function is expected to return a value that is stored to a
    memcached server, first translated by `to_cache` if provided. In the event
    of a cache hit, the data is translated by `from_cache` if provided, before
    being returned. If you do not want a result to be cached, wrap the return
    value of your function in a `DoNotCache` object.

    Examples:

    .. code-block:: python

        @memcached(\'127.0.0.1:11211\')
        def _listdir(path):
            return os.path.listdir(path)

    Note:
        If using the default key function, ensure that repr() is implemented on
        all your arguments and that they are hashable.

    Note:
        `from_cache` and `to_cache` both accept the value as first parameter,
        then the target function\'s arguments follow.

    Args:
        servers (str or list of str): memcached server uri(s), eg \'127.0.0.1:11211\'.
            This arg can be None also, in which case memcaching is disabled.
        key (typing.Optional[typing.Callable]): Function that, given the target function\'s args,
            returns the string key to use in memcached.
        from_cache (typing.Optional[typing.Callable]): If provided, and a cache hit occurs, the
            cached value will be translated by this function before being returned.
        to_cache (typing.Optional[typing.Callable]): If provided, and a cache miss occurs, the
            function\'s return value will be translated by this function before
            being cached.
        time (int): Tells memcached the time which this value should expire, either
            as a delta number of seconds, or an absolute unix time-since-the-epoch
            value. See the memcached protocol docs section "Storage Commands"
            for more info on <exptime>. We default to 0 == cache forever.
        min_compress_len (int): The threshold length to kick in auto-compression
            of the value using the zlib.compress() routine. If the value being cached is
            a string, then the length of the string is measured, else if the value is an
            object, then the length of the pickle result is measured. If the resulting
            attempt at compression yeilds a larger string than the input, then it is
            discarded. For backwards compatability, this parameter defaults to 0,
            indicating don\'t ever try to compress.
        debug (bool): If True, memcache keys are kept human readable, so you can
            read them if running a foreground memcached proc with \'memcached -vv\'.
            However this increases chances of key clashes so should not be left
            turned on.
