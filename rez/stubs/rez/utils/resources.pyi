class Resource(metaclass=LazyAttributeMeta):
    """Abstract base class for a data resource.

    A resource is an object uniquely identified by a 'key' (the resource type),
    and a dict of variables. For example, a very simple banking system might
    have a resource type with key 'account.checking', and a single variable
    'account_owner' that uniquely identifies each checking account.

    Resources may have a schema, which describes the data associated with the
    resource. For example, a checking account might have a current balance (an
    integer) and a social security number (also an integer).

    Keys in a resource's schema are mapped onto the resource class. So a
    checking account instance 'account' would have attributes 'account.balance',
    'account.ssn' etc. Attributes are lazily validated, using the schema, on
    first access.

    A resource's data is loaded lazily, on first attribute access. This,
    combined with lazy attribute validation, means that many resources can be
    iterated, while potentially expensive operations (data loading, attribute
    validation) are put off as long as possible.

    Note:
        You can access the entire validated resource data dict using the
        `validated_data` function, and test full validation using `validate_data`.

    A resource wrapper is useful for two main reasons. First, we can wrap

    interface. This is useful when the same resource can be loaded from various
    different sources (perhaps a database and the filesystem for example), and
    further common functionality needs to be supplied.

    Second, some resource attributes can be derived from the resource's
    variables, which means the resource's data doesn't need to be loaded to get
    these attributes. The wrapper can provide its own properties that do this,
    avoiding unnecessary data loads.

    You must subclass this class and provide `keys` - the list of attributes in
    the resource that you want to expose in the wrapper. The `schema_keys`
    function is provided to help get a list of keys from a resource schema.
