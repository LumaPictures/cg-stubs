def encode_filesystem_name(input_str):
    '''Encodes an arbitrary unicode string to a generic filesystem-compatible
    non-unicode filename.

    The result after encoding will only contain the standard ascii lowercase
    letters (a-z), the digits (0-9), or periods, underscores, or dashes
    (".", "_", or "-").  No uppercase letters will be used, for
    comaptibility with case-insensitive filesystems.

    The rules for the encoding are:

    1. Any lowercase letter, digit, period, or dash (a-z, 0-9, ., or -) is
    encoded as-is.

    2. Any underscore is encoded as a double-underscore (``__``)

    3. Any uppercase ascii letter (A-Z) is encoded as an underscore followed
    by the corresponding lowercase letter (ie, "A" => "_a")

    4. All other characters are encoded using their UTF-8 encoded unicode
       representation, in the following format: ``_NHH...``, where:

       * N represents the number of bytes needed for the UTF-8 encoding,
         except with N=0 for one-byte representation (the exception for N=1
         is made both because it means that for "standard" ascii characters
         in the range 0-127, their encoding will be _0xx, where xx is their
         ascii hex code; and because it mirrors the ways UTF-8 encoding
         itself works, where the number of bytes needed for the character can
         be determined by counting the number of leading "1"s in the binary
         representation of the character, except that if it is a 1-byte
         sequence, there are 0 leading 1\'s).
       * HH represents the bytes of the corresponding UTF-8 encoding, in
         hexadecimal (using lower-case letters)

         As an example, the character ``*``, whose (hex) UTF-8 representation
         of 2A, would be encoded as "_02a", while the "euro" symbol, which
         has a UTF-8 representation of E2 82 AC, would be encoded as
         "_3e282ac".  (Note that, strictly speaking, the "N" part of the
         encoding is redundant information, since it is essentially encoded
         in the UTF-8 representation itself, but it makes the resulting
         string more human-readable, and easier to decode).

    As an example, the string "Foo_Bar (fun).txt" would get encoded as ``_foo___bar_020_028fun_029.txt``.
