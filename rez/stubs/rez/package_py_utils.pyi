def expand_requirement(request: str, paths: Incomplete | None = None) -> str:
    """Expands a requirement string like ``python-2.*``, ``foo-2.*+<*``, etc.

    Wildcards are expanded to the latest version that matches. There is also a
    special wildcard ``**`` that will expand to the full version, but it cannot
    be used in combination with ``*``.

    Wildcards MUST placehold a whole version token, not partial - while ``foo-2.*``
    is valid, ``foo-2.v*`` is not.

    Wildcards MUST appear at the end of version numbers - while ``foo-1.*.*`` is
    valid, ``foo-1.*.0`` is not.

    It is possible that an expansion will result in an invalid request string
    (such as ``foo-2+<2``). The appropriate exception will be raised if this
    happens.

    Examples:

        >>> print(expand_requirement('python-2.*'))
        python-2.7
        >>> print(expand_requirement('python==2.**'))
        python==2.7.12
        >>> print(expand_requirement('python<**'))
        python<3.0.5

    Args:
        request (str): Request to expand, eg ``python-2.*``
        paths (typing.Optional[list[str]]): paths to search for package families,
            defaults to :data:`packages_path`.

    Returns:
        str: Expanded request string.
