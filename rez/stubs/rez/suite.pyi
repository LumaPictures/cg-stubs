    """A collection of contexts.

    A suite is a collection of contexts. A suite stores its contexts in a
    single directory, and creates wrapper scripts for each tool in each context,
    which it stores into a single bin directory. When a tool is invoked, it
    executes the actual tool in its associated context. When you add a suite's
    bin directory to PATH, you have access to all these tools, which will
    automatically run in correctly configured environments.

    Tool clashes can occur when a tool of the same name is present in more than
    one context. When a context is added to a suite, or prefixed/suffixed, that
    context's tools override tools from other contexts.

    There are several ways to avoid tool name clashes:

    - Hide a tool. This removes it from the suite even if it does not clash;
    - Prefix/suffix a context. When you do this, all the tools in the context
      have the prefix/suffix applied;
    - Explicitly alias a tool using the `alias_tool` method. This takes
      precedence over context prefix/suffixing.
