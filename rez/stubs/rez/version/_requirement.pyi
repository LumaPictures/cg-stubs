class Requirement(_Common):
    '''
    Defines a requirement for an object. For example, ``foo-5+`` means that you
    require any version of ``foo``, version 5 or greater. An unversioned
    requirement can also be used (``foo``), this means you require any version of
    foo. You can drop the hyphen between object name and version range if the
    version range starts with a non-alphanumeric character - eg ``foo<2``.

    There are two different prefixes that can be applied to a requirement:

    - ``!``: The conflict requirement. This means that you require this version
      range of an object NOT to be present. To conflict with all versions of an
      object, use "!foo".
    - ``~``: This is known as a "weak reference", and means, "I do not require this
      object, but if present, it must be within this range." It is equivalent to
      the *conflict of the inverse* of the given version range.

    There is one subtle case to be aware of. ``~foo`` is a requirement that has no
    effect. It means "I do not require foo, but if foo is present, it can
    be any version." This statement is still valid, but will produce a
    Requirement object with a None range.

    Examples of valid requirement strings:

    - ``foo-1.0``
    - ``foo@1.0``
    - ``foo#1.0``
    - ``foo-1+``
    - ``foo-1+<4.3``
    - ``foo<3``
    - ``foo==1.0.1``
