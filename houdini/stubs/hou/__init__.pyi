class parmNamingScheme:
    '''

    hou.parmNamingScheme

    Enumeration of available naming schemes for a parameter.

    These naming schemes are stored inside hou.ParmTemplate objects and
    determine the names of hou.Parm objects inside hou.ParmTuple objects.

    The number of components in the parm template determines the number of
    parms inside the parm tuple. If this number is 1, the parm name is the
    same as the parm tuple name. If the naming scheme is Base1, the number
    of components may be more than 4. Otherwise, the component may have from
    2 components up to the maximum number allowed by the naming scheme.

    The following restrictions exist on naming schemes:

      * You cannot use the following naming schemes when editing the
        parameter interface on a node or a digital asset: MinMax, MaxMin,
        StartEnd, BeginEnd, XYWH. However, some built-in node types use
        parameters with these naming schemes, so asking these node types for
        their parm templates may return ones using these naming schemes.

      * String and toggle parameters only support the Base1 naming scheme.

      * Parameters with the hou.parmLook.Vector look must use the XYZW
        naming scheme.

      * Parameters with the hou.parmLook.Angle look must use the Base1
        naming scheme.

      * Parameters with the hou.parmLook.ColorSquare look must use an RGBA
        naming scheme.

            A standard menu that displays the currently selected menu item.

            A condensed menu that only displays a dropdown arrow. Houdini
            lets you choose a menu entry when you click on this arrow.

            A standard menu that displays the currently selected menu item.

            displayed without a label. However unlike simply turning off the
            label and joining to the next parameter, the layout of the next

            already there, and will remove it from the field it if was. This

            for example) will not trigger this callback. Houdini also does
            not trigger this event when a node changes if that node's data
            or parameters are referenced through expressions. Only nodes
            connected to this node as an input will trigger this callback.

        ParmTupleChanged
            Runs after a parameter value changes. You can get the new value
            using hou.ParmTuple.eval.

            Extra keyword argument: parm_tuple (hou.ParmTuple).


            NOTE
                If many/all parameters on the node change at the same time,
                instead of calling the handler for each one, Houdini will
                call the handler once with a parm_tuple argument of None.
                Your callback code should handle this possibility.

        ParmTupleAnimated
            Runs after a parameter value changes from an undo/redo change or
            a major animation editor change. It isn't called during
            playback. You can get the new value using hou.ParmTuple.eval.

            Extra keyword argument: parm_tuple (hou.ParmTuple).


            NOTE
                If many/all parameters on the node change at the same time,
                instead of calling the handler for each one, Houdini will
                call the handler once with a parm_tuple argument of None.
                Your callback code should handle this possibility.

        ParmTupleChannelChanged
            Runs after a parameter value changes from a minor animation
            editor change. It isn't called during playback. You can get the
            new value using hou.ParmTuple.eval.

            Extra keyword argument: parm_tuple (hou.ParmTuple).


            NOTE
                If many/all parameters on the node change at the same time,
                instead of calling the handler for each one, Houdini will
                call the handler once with a parm_tuple argument of None.
                Your callback code should handle this possibility.

        ParmTupleLockChanged
            Runs after a parameter lock state has changed. You can get the
            new lock value using hou.Parm.isLocked.

            Extra keyword argument: parm_tuple (hou.ParmTuple).

        ParmTupleEnabledChanged
            Runs after a parameter enabled state has changed. You can get
            the new enabled state value using hou.Parm.isDisabled.

        ParmTupleVisibleChanged
            Runs after a parameter visible state has changed. You can get
            the new visibility value using hou.Parm.isHidden.

        ChildCreated
            For a subnet node (for example, a Geometry object), runs after a
            new node is created inside.

            Extra keyword argument: child_node (hou.OpNode)

        ChildDeleted
            For a subnet node (for example, a Geometry object), runs before
            a node is deleted inside. You cannot cancel the deletion.

            Extra keyword argument: child_node (hou.OpNode)

        ChildSwitched
            For a subnet node (for example, a Geometry object), runs after
            the current node, display flag, or render flag changes inside
            (meaning the 3D view will change).

            Extra keyword argument: child_node (hou.OpNode) -- the newly
            selected child node.

        ChildSelectionChanged
            For a subnet node (for example, a Geometry object), runs after
            the selection changes inside. The selection can consist of
            nodes, network boxes, sticky notes, indirect subnet inputs, or
            network dots. You can get the new selection with
            hou.Node.selectedItems.

        NetworkBoxCreated
            Runs after a new network box is created inside this node.

        NetworkBoxChanged
            Runs after an item is added to or removed from a network box
            inside this node. In some cases is may be possible to receive a
            NetworkBoxChanged callback for a new network box before
            receiving the NetworkBoxCreated callback.

        NetworkBoxDeleted
            Runs right before a network box is deleted from inside this
            node.

        StickyNoteCreated
            Runs after a new network box is created inside this node.

        StickyNoteChanged
            Runs after a new sticky note's text is changed inside this node.
            In some cases is may be possible to receive a StickyNoteChanged
            callback for a new network box before receiving the
            StickyNoteCreated callback.

        StickyNoteDeleted
            Runs right before a sticky note is deleted from inside this
            node.

        IndirectInputCreated
            Runs after a new indirect input is created inside this node.
            This will generally be a Network Dot, but may in some cases be a
            Subnet Indirect Input.

        IndirectInputRewired
            Runs after the input connection to an indirect input is changed.
            Since Subnet Indirect Inputs don't have input connections, this
            will only occur on a Network Dot.

        IndirectInputDeleted
            Runs before an indirect input is deleted from inside this node.
            This will generally be a Network Dot, but may in some cases be a
            Subnet Indirect Input.

        SpareParmTemplatesChanged
            Runs after a spare parameter is modified on, added to, or
            removed from the node.


            NOTE
                If the node has spare parameters, this event triggers when
                any parameter is modified, not just a spare parameter.

        SelectionChanged
            Runs after the selection associated with a node changes. This
            only applies to the geometry selected on a SOP node, or the
            scene graph primitives selected in a LOP Network.

        CustomDataChanged
            Runs after some custom data on a node is changed. The custom
            data available, and the methods for accessing it, will depend on
            the hou.NodeType of the node that is changing. One example of
            custom node data is the viewport scene overrides that can be
            applied to a LOP Network.

        WorkItemSelectionChanged
            For a TOP network, runs after the selected work item has a
            changed.

            Extra keyword argument: work_item_id - the ID of the selected
            work item

            Extra keyword argument: selected_node - the selected TOP node,
            if a selection exists

    hou.NodeError

    Raise this exception in a Python node to signal that the node is in

    OVERVIEW

        This is different from other exceptions that are typically raised by
        the system when something goes wrong, such as invalid inputs to a
        method call. This is an exception you, the author of a Python SOP,
        or Python Object, or Python LOP, etc., raise in the node\'s
        implementation script to set messages/warnings/errors on the node.

        Errors, warnings, and messages are part of a node\'s user interface.
        They show up in the network editor, parameter editor, and info
        window.

      * Errors signal to the node\'s user that the node has encountered an
        error. For example, invalid inputs or parameter values.

      * Warnings signal that the node was able to cook, but there was a
        problem the user might want to check. For example, a missing
        texture.

        See Writing Python SOPs for more information.


        TIP
            To mark the node with a warning instead of an error, raise
            hou.NodeWarning instead.

    EXAMPLE

        If you\'re writing a Python SOP, you might depend on information in
        an external file, specified by a parameter on the node:

      > thisnode = hou.pwd()
      > filepath = thisnode.parm(\\"file\\").evalAsString()
      > content = hou.readFile(filepath)
      > # ...

        If the file doesn\'t exist, you should raise this exception to signal
        to Houdini that the node could not cook, and specify an error
        message to help the user correct the problem:

      > import os.path
      > 
      > thisnode = hou.pwd()

            Return the network item at the given path, or None if no such item
            exists. If you pass in a relative path (i.e. the path does not start
            with /), searches are performed relative to this node.

            If the path is an absolute path (i.e. it starts with /), this method
            is a shortcut for hou.item(node_path). Otherwise, it is a shortcut
            for hou.item(self.path() + \\"/\\" + item_path). See also hou.item.

            Note that the return value may be an instance of a subclass of
            NetworkMovableItem. For example, if the item being found is an
            object node, the return value will be a hou.ObjNode instance. If the
            item is a network box, the return value will be a hou.NetworkBox

            The pattern may contain multiple pieces, separated by spaces. An
            asterisk (*) in a pattern piece will match any character. By
            default, Houdini will add the nodes from each pattern piece to those
            already matched. However, if the pattern piece begins with a caret
            (^), Houdini will remove the matches for that piece from the result.

            By default the pattern match is case-sensitive. Set ignore_case to
            True for case-insensitive pattern matching. Note that case
            insensitivity only applies when matching node names. It does not
            apply when matching group, network box or bundle names.

            matches the pattern. However, any matching child will have all its
            children added, recursively. As well, the result may be filtered by
            node type.

            Houdini first matches children nodes against the pattern, then
            recursively adds the subchildren of matching children, and then
            applies the filter.


            pattern
                Child node names will be matched against this string pattern.
                See hou.Node.glob and hou.NodeBundle for information about the
                pattern syntax. Note that if a child node matches the pattern
                and include_subnets is True, all of its subchildren will be
                added to the result (subject to filtering), regardless of the
                pattern.

            filter
                A hou.nodeTypeFilter enumeration value to limit matched nodes to
                a particular type (e.g. object nodes, geometry object nodes,
                surface shader SHOPs, etc.).

                Specifies whether the children of a matching node will also be
                returned, regardless of the pattern.

            The pattern and filter behavior is very similar to that used by node
            bundles in Houdini. See hou.NodeBundle for more information.

            node_name
                The name of the new node. If not specified, Houdini appends a

                matches the given node_type_name may be used. For example, the

            Return a list of nodes that are children of this node. Using the
            file system analogy, a node's children are like the contents of a
            folder/directory.

            To find the number of children nodes, use len(node.children()).

            The order of the children in the result is the same as the user
            defined ordering in Houdini. To see this order, switch the network
            view pane into list mode, and ensure that the list order is set to
            user defined. To reorder nodes, drag and drop them in the list.

        '''

        allSubChildren(self, top_down=True, recurse_in_locked_nodes=True,
        sync_delayed_definition=False) -> tuple of hou.Node

            Recursively return all sub children of this node. For example,
            hou.node(\\"/\\").allSubChildren() will return all the nodes in the hip
            file.


            top_down
                If True, this function will do a top-down traversal, placing a
                node in the returned tuple before its children. If False, it
                will do a bottom-up traversal, placing children before their
                parents.

            recurse_in_locked_nodes
                If True, the function will recurse inside locked child nodes
                (child nodes for which the isEditable() method returns False)
                and include children of the locked child nodes in the returned
                tuple.

                If False, the function will not recurse inside locked children
                nodes, and children of the locked child nodes will not be
                included in the returned tuple. (The locked child nodes,
                however, will be included.)

                For example if <recurse_in_locked_nodes> is True and
                hou.node(\\"/obj/geo1\\") contains a Platonic Solids node (a locked
                node), then the tuple returned by
                hou.node(\\"/obj\\").allSubChildren() will include the Platonic
                Solids node and its child nodes. If <recurse_in_locked_nodes> is
                False, the returned tuple will contain the Platonic Solids node,
                but not its child nodes.

            sync_delayed_definition
                The contents of nodes may some times not be loaded until the
                node is evaluated. To avoid expanding all nodes unnecessarily,
                by default these are left un-expanded so the contents will not
                be returned. Setting <sync_delayed_definition> to True will
                recursively sync all children, fully instantiating the entire
                network, and returning all the synced nodes.

            Note that a tuple is returned, not a generator. This means that it
            is safe to delete or create nodes while looping through the return
            value.

            The following function deletes all children of a particular type
            that appear anywhere inside a given node:

          > def removeSubChildrenOfType(node, node_type):
          >     \'\'\'Recursively delete all children of a particular type.\'\'\'

          >         if child.type() == node_type:
          >             child.destroy()

            This code, for example, removes all the visibility SOPs anywhere
            under /obj:

    hou.OpNode

    The base class for all nodes in Houdini (objects, SOPs, COPs, etc.) An
    instance of this class corresponds to exactly one instance of a node in
    Houdini.

    Each node has a unique path that defines its location in the tree of
    nodes. The node path hierarchy is similar to the hierarchy of folders
    and files in a file system. Some nodes, called networks, may contain
    other nodes inside them, much like a file folder would, while other
    nodes may not. For example, an object node instance and a SOP subnetwork
    node instance may contain SOP nodes, but a box SOP instance may not.


    TIP
        Be careful not to confuse nodes with node types. A node is an
        instance of a node type. For example suppose /obj/geo1/box1 is a box
        SOP. It has its own unique name (box1) and its own copies of
        parameter values. It is an instance of the box SOP node type. This
        node type defines what parameters are common to all box SOP node
        instances, as well as the algorithm that each BOX SOP performs. The
        class that represents a node type is hou.NodeType.

    You cannot create instances of hou.Node using hou.Node.__init__.
    Instead, you look up Node objects corresponding to existing Houdini
    nodes with hou.node(). To create a new Houdini node instance inside
    another node, use hou.Node.createNode. To delete a Houdini node, use
    hou.Node.destroy.

    Note that a Node object internally stores a reference to the
    corresponding Houdini node, and that their lifetimes are different. If a
    Python node object is deleted because its reference count in Python goes
    to zero, the Houdini node will be unaffected. On the other hand, if you
    have a Node object in a Python variable and the Houdini node is deleted,
    the Python variable will still exist, and Python will not crash.
    Instead, if you later call a method on that Python Node object, Houdini
    will raise a hou.ObjectWasDeleted exception.

    Be careful not to confuse this class with the function hou.node.

            parameters in the folder and its subfolders (if any).


            folder_names
                A sequence of folder name strings. For example, to get a list of
                the parameters in the Shading folder of the Render folder, use
                (\\"Render\\", \\"Shading\\"). Note that by folder name, we mean the
                label used in the parameter dialog, not the internal parameter
                name.

                If this sequence is empty, the method returns all parameters on
                the node, the same as if you called parms().

            Raises hou.OperationFailed if the folder specified by folder_names
            does not exist.

            For example, suppose a node had a Render folder that contained a
            Shading subfolder. Then this line of code would return the
            parameters in the Render folder:

          > # Note the trailing comma after \\"Render\\" to tell Python that \\"Render\\" is
          > # contained in a tuple/sequence as opposed to just a single string with
          > # parentheses around it.
          > >>> node.parmsInFolder((\\"Render\\", ))

            And this line of code would return the parameters in the Shading
            subfolder.

                A string containing name of the shader context for the code.
                This option applies to nodes such as the Material Shader Builder
                which can generate code for multiple context types.

                For example, a Material network might contain both surface and

            for nodes implemented in Python that want to save temporary values
            between cooks, to avoid recomputing them on subsequent cooks.

            The following example illustrates how to set, access, and delete
            cached user-defined data:

          > >>> n = hou.node(\\"/obj\\").createNode(\\"geo\\")
          > >>> n.setCachedUserData(\\"my data\\", [1, 2, {\\"a\\": \\"b\\", \\"c\\": \\"d\\"}])
          > >>> n.cachedUserData(\\"my data\\")
          > [1, 2, {\'a\': \'b\', \'c\': \'d\'}]
          > >>> n.cachedUserDataDict()
          > {\'my data\': [1, 2, {\'a\': \'b\', \'c\': \'d\'}]}
          > >>> n.destroyCachedUserData(\\"my data\\")
          > >>> n.cachedUserDataDict()
          > {}
          > >>> print n.cachedUserData(\\"my data\\")
          > None

            See per-node user-defined data for more information and examples.

            Return the user-defined cached data with this name, or None if no

            Note that None is a valid value for a key, so the most reliable way

        addEventCallback(self, event_types, callback)

            Registers a Python callback that Houdini will call whenever a
            particular action, or event, occurs on this particular node
            instance.

            Callbacks only persist for the current session. For example, they
            are not saved to the .hip file. If you want persistent callbacks in
            every session, you can add them in code in 456.py (runs when the
            user opens a .hip file). See where to add Python scripting for more
            information.


            event_types
                A sequence of hou.nodeEventType enumeration values describing
                the event types that will cause Houdini to call the callback
                function.

            callback
                A callable Python object, such as a function or bound method.
                Houdini will call this function whenever one of the event types
                in event_types occurs.

                Houdini calls the function with an event_type keyword argument
                containing the hou.nodeEventType value corresponding to the
                event that triggered the callback.

                Houdini will pass additional keyword arguments depending on the
                event type. For example, in a callback for the ParmTupleChanged
                event, Houdini will pass a parm_tuple keyword argument
                containing a hou.ParmTuple reference to the parameter that
                changed. See hou.nodeEventType for the extra arguments (if any)
                passed for each event type.

                You can add **kwargs to the argument list to accept all keyword
                arguments, to allow the same callback to be used for different
                events, or to be safe from future changes:

              > def event_callback(event_type, **kwargs):
              >     ...

            NOTE
                If you try to add the exact same callback function more than
                once, Houdini will still only call the function only once in
                response to an event. However, it may be useful to add the same
                function if you want to register it with different event_types.

            Raises hou.OperationFailed if the event_types list argument is
            empty.

            The following example shows to set up a function that\'s called
            whenever a certain node\'s name changes:

          > 
          > def name_changed(node, event_type, **kwargs):
          >     print(\\"The geometry object is now named\\", node.name())

    Each object has a transformation (or transform) encapsulating its

            Adjust this object's parameters to achieve the desired world
            transformation.

            This method will adjust the translate, rotate, and scale values of
            this object to achieve the desired final world transform. It
            accounts for the transforms of containing networks, parent

            If fail_on_locked_parms is True, and any of the translate, rotate,

            hou.OperationFailed. If it is False and any of those parameters are
            locked, this method will change their values but leave them locked.

            Suppose:

          * W is the desired new world transform,

          * W' is the existing world transform,

          * L is the desired transform defined by the node's parameters,

          * L' is the existing parm transform,

          * P is the object's pre-transform,

          * O is the parent transform combined with the containing subnet's,
            transform

            Then, since W = L * P * O we have P = W * O^ * R^. So, this method
            could be implemented as follows:

          > def setWorldTransform(self):
          > self.setParmTransform(
          >     matrix * self.parentAndSubnetTransform().inverted() * self.preTransform().inverted(),
          >     fail_on_locked_parms)

            Alternately, we can derive L from W' and L' as follows:

          * W' = L' * P * O

          * so P * O = L^' * W'

          * and (P * O)^ = W^' * L' and

          * W = L * P * O

          * so L = W * (P * O)^

          * giving L = W * W'^ * L'

            Thus, this method could also be implemented using the current world
            and parm transforms as follows:

          > def setWorldTransform(self):
          > self.setParmTransform(
          >     matrix * self.worldTransform().inverted() * self.parmTransform(),
          >     fail_on_locked_parms)

            Note that, because parm transforms cannot contain shears, it is
            possible that the resulting world transform will not match the
            desired transform. If r is a function that removes shears from a
            transform then the new world transform will actually be L * P * O =
            r(W * O^ * P^) * P * O.

class ParmTemplate:
    '''

    hou.ParmTemplate

    Describes a parameter tuple (its name, type, etc.). This is base class
    for all parameter templates.

    ParmTemplates are most often used when describing a parameter in a
    digital asset definition\'s parameter interface or when describing an
    individual node\'s parameter layout (including its spare parameters). A
    ParmTemplate describes a parameter and the type of data it holds, but it
    does not store the current value of a parameter; only hou.Parm objects
    inside hou.ParmTuple objects actually store parameter values. You can
    think of a hou.ParmTuple as an instance of a ParmTemplate. For example,
    the \\"t\\" parm tuple on geometry objects can be described by a
    hou.FloatParmTemplate -- it has a label of \\"Transform\\", a data type of
    hou.parmData.Float, 3 components, a naming scheme of
    hou.parmNamingScheme.XYZW, etc. Each geometry object node has a
    hou.ParmTuple named \\"t\\" that uses this ParmTemplate.

    Note that ParmTemplate objects are just data containers, and they have
    no live relationship with objects in Houdini. For example, a hou.OpNode
    object corresponds directly to a node in Houdini, and if the node is
    renamed in Houdini hou.Node.name will return the new name.
    ParmTemplates, on the other hand, do not have a live relationship.
    Creating a ParmTemplate based on a spare parameter or asset definition
    parameter will simply copy the information into the ParmTemplate object,
    and modifying the object will not affect the spare parameter/asset
    parameter.

    Note also that ParmTemplate objects are always instances of a subclass
    of this class, so you cannot construct an instance of this class
    directly.

    To manipulate the parameters of a digital asset, you can retrieve the
    asset\'s current set of ParmTemplates into a hou.ParmTemplateGroup using
    hou.HDADefinition.parmTemplateGroup. You can then modify the group,
    adding parameters to it and replacing parameters in it, and save the
    group back to the asset definition with
    hou.HDADefinition.setParmTemplateGroup. Similarly, you can change a
    node\'s parameter layout with hou.OpNode.parmTemplateGroup and
    hou.OpNode.setParmTemplateGroup.

    You can also ask a hou.ParmTuple for its ParmTemplate in order to find
    out information about the parameter, such as allowed ranges of values,
    the label displayed to the user in the parameter pane, the parameter\'s
    popup help, etc.

class ParmTemplateGroup:
    """

    hou.ParmTemplateGroup

    A group of parameter templates used to represent the parameter layout of
    a node or the parameters in a digital asset definition.

    This class stores a group of hou.ParmTemplate objects. You can create an
    empty group, create a group from a sequence of parm templates, or create
    a group from the parameter definitions of a digital asset or from a
    particular node's current parameter layout. Similarly, you can set an
    asset's parameters or a node's parameter interface to the contents of a
    parameter group.

    You can get an asset's parm templates with
    hou.HDADefinition.parmTemplateGroup and set them with
    hou.HDADefinition.setParmTemplateGroup. Similarly, you can get an
    individual node's parameter definition with hou.OpNode.parmTemplateGroup
    and set it with hou.OpNode.setParmTemplateGroup. When setting a node's
    parameter interface, any parms that are not in the node's type's set of
    parms will be added as spare parameters. Similarly, if parameters in the
    node's type are not present in the group, they will be automatically
    added at the end and made invisible. Also, if they exist but the types,
    labels, looks, naming schemes, etc are different, Houdini will discard
    all changes you attempt to make to these reserved parameters except for
    visibility settings.

    It is important to understand the difference between folder parm
    templates and folder set parm templates when using ParmTemplateGroups.
    Folder sets correspond directly to hou.ParmTuple objects -- there is one
    parm tuple (that contains one parm) for each set of folders, and
    changing the value of that parm changes which folder is displayed.
    Individual Folders, on the other hand, do not directly correspond to
    hou.ParmTuple objects, but they are used in Houdini's <Type Properties>
    dialog and they make it easy to add individual folders and control which
    parameters are inside a folder. Unlike a hou.FolderSetParmTemplate, a
    hou.FolderParmTemplate stores the set of parm templates inside that
    folder. When a node or definition's parameters are set to the contents
    of a parm template group, the folder sets are determined and the parm
    tuple name for the set is the name of the first folder in that set. The
    names of the other folders in the set are not used.

    ParmTemplateGroups use folder parm templates instead of folder set parm
    templates. Attempting to add a FolderSetParmTemplate to a group will
    raise hou.OperationFailed. Asking a parm tuple for its parm template, on
    the other hand, may return a folder set but will never return a folder.
    Previously, folder parameter templates and parm template groups did not
    exist, so the only way to add folders were with special methods like
    hou.HDADefinition.addParmFolder and hou.OpNode.addSpareParmFolder. Now
    that that they exist, you may create folders by passing folder parm
    templates to hou.HDADefinition.addParmTuple and
    hou.OpNode.addSpareParmTuple. However, using parm template groups is
    preferred over calling these methods.

    Note that folder parm templates are also used to represent multiparm
    blocks, much like the <Type Properties> dialog does. The folder parm
    template's hou.folderType determines whether it is a folder or a
    multiparm block. Unlike folder parm templates, which do not correspond
    directly to parameter instances, a multiparm parm template does
    correspond to an integer parameter that controls the number of instances
    of the multiparm.


    NOTE
        ParmTemplateGroups store their own copy of the parm templates.
        Asking for the parm templates in a group will return a copy of the
        parm templates; modifying those copies will not change the contents
        of the group. For example, to change a parameter in a group you
        cannot simply call find and modify the hou.ParmTemplate it returned.
        Instead, you must call replace after making modifications to the
        parameter.

        Parm template copies returned by the the ParmTemplateGroup can be
        used as arguments to methods that accept parm templates as layout
        placeholders (i.e. insertBefore, insertAfter, appendToFolder, etc.).
        However, changes made to the ParmTemplateGroup will invalidate any
        previously returned parm template copies as layout placeholders. In
        that case, you need to obtain new parm template copies from the
        group.

            Create a new group from an optional sequence of parm templates. If
            none are passed in, the new group will be empty.

            Because groups and folder parm templates can both be constructed
            using a sequence of contained parm templates, it is possible to
            construct a parm template group with parameters inside folders using
            a single expression. The following example creates a group with two
            folders and with parameters inside each of those folders:

          > >>> group = hou.ParmTemplateGroup((
          > ... hou.FolderParmTemplate(\\"folder\\", \\"Physical\\", (
          > ...     hou.FloatParmTemplate(\\"mass\\", \\"Mass\\", 1),

          > ... )),
          > ... ))

            sequence are hou.FolderSetParmTemplate objects.

            Note that this function returns a copy of the parm template stored
            in this group. Modifying the copy will not affect the parameters in
            this group. The following example shows how to use the find and
            replace methods to modify the \\"pos\\" parm template in the group:

          > >>> parm_template.setLabel(\\"Position\\")
          > >>> group.replace(\\"pos\\", parm_template)

            If you created the group from existing parameters, folder parm
            templates in the same folder set will share the same name, so
            searching for a folder using this method may return the first folder
            in the folder set. To instead search for a folder by its folder
            label, use findFolder.

            Note that, in general, the group does not prevent you from adding
            two parameters with the same name. In this case, searching for a
            parameter with this name will return the first one. Note, though,
            that when when setting this group to a node or asset definition\'s
            parms, either the duplicate parameters will be renamed on an
            exception will be raised. See the rename_conflicting_parms parameter

            The default behavior for reserved parameters is to output baseparm
            tokens for reserved parameters so that it is resistant to changes in
            their definition. To change this, use full_info=True.

            The script_name, script_label and script_tags parameters specify
            additional data that is saved to the dialog script header as the
            name, label, and parmtag options respectively. The script_tags
            dictionary should map strings to strings. Each entry is saved to the
            dialog script as a separate parmtag. The interpretation of these
            additional header elements depends on where this dialog script is
            being used. When used to provide the parameter definitions for an
            HDA, these elements are ignored. But when using the dialog script as
            a source of render properties, these additional elements will be

    hou.DopData

    A piece of data stored inside a DOP network's simulation.

    Each DOP network builds a tree of data, and then Houdini examines and
    updates this tree when it runs the simulation. DOP data elements can be
    DOP objects, geometry, volumes, forces, solvers, etc. The data is
    arranged in a tree structure, where child nodes are called subdata and
    are said to be attached to their parent nodes. Under the root of the
    tree are usually the DOP objects and data describing their
    relationships.

    Note that the same piece of data can appear in the tree in multiple
    locations, with different names. DopData objects thus do not store their
    name, and the name of a piece of data in the tree is instead stored with
    its parent data(s).

    By default, DopData objects store the path within the tree to the data.
    As a consequence, if the time changes and the solvers within the
    simulation change the contents of the tree of data, the Python DopData
    object will update to refer to the simulation's new state. If the data
    path no longer refers to valid data, Houdini raises hou.ObjectWasDeleted
    when you try to access the DopData object from Python.

    If you do not want the DopData to update with changes to the simulation,
    you can call hou.DopData.freeze. freeze returns another DopData object
    that refers the simulation's state at the current time, and will not
    change when the simulation time changes.

    Each piece of data can contain records, and each record stores a list of
    name and value pairs called fields. Each record has a name, but it's
    possible for multiple records with the same name to exist in the same
    piece of data. In this case, the record also has an index, and you can
    think of the records as rows of a spreadsheet.

    """

    hou.AssetGalleryDataSource

    Provides an interface to any data source that can be used in association
    with an asset or snapshot gallery UI.

    Houdini's various asset gallery panels (the snapshot gallery attached to
    the LOP Scene Viewer, the Working Set gallery in the Layout LOP's brush
    panel, and the Asset Gallery pane) are all populated by pulling data
    from this class. This object is created by providing a source
    identifier, and an optional additional string argument. The source
    identifier is used to find or create a shared underlying data source
    implementation object (which may be a C++ or python object). These
    implementation objects are responsible for responding to the methods
    called on this object.

    Houdini ships with three data source implementations. One uses an SQL
    database with read and write capabilities. This data source
    implementation type is used when the source identifier is a file path
    with a .db, .sqlite, or .sqlite3 extension. Another supports any file on
    disk with a USD file extension. This data source is read only, and
    accepts an additional argument specifying the primitive pattern
    indicating which primitives in the USD file should be presented as
    assets. Finally, if the source identifier beings with an op: prefix
    followed by a path to a LOP node, the stage for that LOP node is used as
    a read only data source, and again the additional argument specifies a
    primitive pattern to indicate which primitives on the source stage
    represent assets.

    To create a new data source implementation in C++, you must create a
    subclass of UT_GalleryDataSourceImpl (see UT_GalleryDataSource.h), and
    register it by calling
    UT_GalleryDataSource::registerDataSourceImplementation. To create a new
    data source implementation in python, create a subclass of the
    DataSource object defined in the husd.datasource module, and place it in
    the $HFS/houdini/husdplugins/datasources directory. See the usdfile.py
    module for an example.

    The methods on this class almost always simply forward the call to the
    underlying data source implementation object. So the decription of each
    method here also serves to document the action an that should be
    undertaken in each correspondingly named method on an implementation
    class.

    hou.Attrib

    This class stores information about a Geometry attribute.

    An attribute describes extra data you can attach to different elements
    of geometry. The attribute values are the individual instances of that
    data, and for each attribute there is exactly one attribute value per
    geometry element. For example, if you look at the points in Houdini's
    geometry spreadsheet, the point numbers are listed down the side, the
    point attributes are listed across the top, and the point attribute
    values are contained in the table.

    The attribute specifies which elements store the attribute values:
    points, primitives, or vertices. An attribute can also be global (also
    known as a detail attribute), in which case there is one instance of the
    attribute value in the geometry.

    The attribute also specifies the data type of the attribute values.

    To look up existing attributes, use hou.Geometry.findPointAttrib,
    hou.Geometry.findPrimAttrib, hou.Geometry.findVertexAttrib, and
    hou.Geometry.findGlobalAttrib. To add a new attribute, use
    hou.Geometry.addAttrib.


    NOTE
        Point positions are stored in a point attribute named P and point
        weights are stored in Pw. See hou.Point.position and

            A string attribute does not store each string value inside the

            and each attribute value stores an index to that string.

            For example, suppose this attribute stores strings on points. If all
            points have the attribute value \\"foo\\" then the string table will be
            just (\\"foo\\",) and each point will store the index 0. When you set

            attribute, and each attribute value stores an index to that
            dictionary.

            For example, suppose this attribute stores dictionaries on points.
            If all points have the attribute value { \\"foo\\" : 1 } then the

            points back to {\\"foo\\":1}, Houdini leaves the dictionary table
            unchanged and stores the index 0 in that point.

            When using dictionary attribute values, this implementation is

    hou.AttribDataId

    Used for detecting when contents of geometry have changed

    Every geometry attribute contains a data id that is incremented whenever
    it is modified (by at least 1). To perform optimizations that depend on
    whether an attribute has changed, these data ids can be cached and then
    compared again to see if they match at some future point in time. If
    they do not match, then one should assume that the contents of the
    attribute is no longer the same as before.

    If two attributes have matching data id values, then you can assume that
    their contents are the same. To preserve data id values across geometry
    copies, set the clone_data_ids parameter on such methods to True.

    This is typically used in a SOP to optimize operations in conjunction
    with setting hou.SopNode.setManagesAttribDataIds to True.


    Note
        The values of data ids are only valid within the same session. They

            Registers a callback to generate custom channel colors based on the
            node and parameter names.


            callback_name
                A name for the custom color scheme. You can use this to remove
                the callback with the unregisterColorsCallback method.

            callback_object
                A Python object with a getChannelColor method. For example:

              > 
              > class MyChannelColors(object):
              >     def getChannelColor(self, node_path, channel_name):
              >         return 0, 0, 0

                The node argument is the path to the node (for example,
                /obj/table). The parm argument is the internal name of the
                channel (for example, tx). The method must return a 3-tuple
                representing normalized (0-1, not 0-255) red, green, and blue
                values. If the method returns (0, 0, 0) Houdini uses the default
                channel color.

            You should register the callback in a session-independent startup
            script. When you register the callback, Houdini will call it once
            with empty string arguments to make sure it returns a triple. Your
            getChannelColor() method needs to handle this case.

            The following example object uses the custom color tint of a node to
            color its channels:

    hou.ChannelPrim

    A ChannelPrim is a geometry primitive (Prim object) which stores channel
    data.

    Channel primitives are lightweight, standalone channels optimized for
    quick evaluation. The following example demonstrates how to construct,
    insert keys into, and evaluate a channel primitive:

    > # Create a mutable geometry
    > g = hou.Geometry()
    > # Add a new channel primitive to the geometry
    > chan = g.createChannelPrim()
    > 
    > keys = [24, 48, 72, 96]
    > values = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]
    > 
    > # Insert keys at the specified frames and set their values
    > for i in range(len(keys)):
    >     chan.insertKey(keys[i])
    >     chan.setKeyValue(keys[i], values[i])
    > 
    > # Smooth the slopes of all keys
    > chan.smoothAutoSlopes()
    > 
    > # Evaluate the channel at frame 36
    > value = chan.eval(36)

    Channel primitives can also be added to the global channel list in order
    to visualize and edit them on the playbar or animation editor. For an
    example of this, see hou.ChannelList.addGeometryChannels.

          runAsClone(start_port=0, end_port=-1, debug=False, block=False,
          print_port=False, connection_timeout_seconds=-1)

        This method opens a network port to receive connections from a host
        process. Once connected, the host process sends its hip file contents
        and any changes made in the host process. This process maintains its
        network state to match the host process, and sends back rendered images
        to the host.

        Both graphical and non-graphical Houdini processes can act as clones.
        Using a graphical Houdini process as a clone may be useful for
        debugging, but generally clone processes will be non-graphical (hbatch
        or hython). Note that the synchronization if one way, from host to
        clones. Changes made in the clone process are not sent to the host
        process, and may cause issues with the synchronization of future changes
        from the host.

        Generally (except for debugging) it is easiest to run a clone process in
        a blocking mode where user input and interaction with the clone process
        is not permitted until the host process disconnects. This is controlled
        with the block parameter.


        start_port
            The lowest TCP/IP port number that can be opened for the host to
            establish a connection. The default value of 0 indicates that any
            available port can be used. In some renderfarm setups, only certain
            ports will allow a connection to be made from the host to the clone
            process. These restrictions will depend on the configuration of the
            firewall between the host and clone machines.

        end_port
            Highest TCP/IP port number that can be opened to receive the host
            connection. The default value of -1 allows any port number higher
            than the start_port.

        debug
            Sets the clone process' networking debug mode. Setting this to True
            will cause additional logging of networking events.

        block
            Controls whether user interation with this process should be
            blocked. This block lasts as long as a host process is connected to
            this clone (or the connection timeout expires without any host
            connection being established).

        print_port
            Set this to True to have this process output its port number to the
            standard output stream. The output will be of the form
            HOUDINI_CLONE_PORT=12345. The printing of this port is often
            necessary for the host process (which often launches the clone
            process) to know what port number it can use to connect to the clone
            process. The only other way to know the clone's port number is by
            setting the start_port and end_port parameters to the same fixed
            value.

        connection_timeout_seconds
            Indicates how long this method should wait for a host connection to
            be established before giving up and closing the connection port.
            This setting can help prevent zombie processes on a render farm, but
            be sure to allocate enough time for the host process to establish
            communication with the clone.

class _clone_Connection:
    """

    hou.clone.Connection

    Represents a connection to a clone process.

    These objects represent an active or potential connection to a Houdini
    clone process, either on the local machine or a remote machine. A
    connection can be connected and disconnected repeatedly, but the object
    continues to be valid. As with hou.Node objects, objects of thie type
    are references to the underlying connection object owned by the Houdini
    cloning framework. This means that all instances of this class that
    refer to the same underlying clone connection will affect each other.
    The underlying object can even be deleted in which case almost all
    methods on this object will raise exceptions (though the
    hou.clone.Connection.isValid method can be used to test if the
    underlying object still exists without raising an exception).

    Clone connections are identified by a unique session id string which
    behaves much like a Houdini node name. At any given time, the session id
    for each clone connection is unique. But session ids can be reused if a
    connection is deleted and a new one created. Clones connections are
    saved to the hip file, and are automatically disconnected when Huodini
    is shut down or a new hip file is opened. When opening a hip file, the
    loaded connection objects are always left in a disconnected state, and
    must be explicitly connected to start the clones processes.

    New connections can only be created by calling hou.clone.createClone or
    hou.clone.Connection.duplicate. Existing connection can be accessed
    using hou.clone.clone or hou.clone.clones.

    hou.CompositorViewer

    Minimal class representing a compositing view pane.

    This class is currently very simple, implementing a minimal number of
    methods necessary to support compositing shelf tools. It does not
    currently allow programmatic control of most functions available in the
    UI.

    You should probably avoid using this object. If you are writing custom
    tools for the compositing view, the higher-level functions in the
    cop2toolutils module are more useful.

            Return a binary string representation of the floats containing all
            the values of all voxels. This method is faster than
            hou.Cop2Node.allPixels, and you can use the array module to convert
            the string into a Python sequence. Note that this method returns
            binary float data, so there are 4 bytes per R, G, and B component,
            not 1 byte.

            The returned binary string is a bytes object in Python 3 and a str
            object in Python 2. See HOM binary data for more information.

            If depth is hou.imageDepth.Float32, this method provides a faster
            implementation of the following:

          > import array
          > def allPixelsAsString(self):
          >     return array.array(\\"f\\", self.allPixels()).tostring()

            If depth is None and this method is called from the code
            implementing a Python COP to get an input plane, the depth will be
            the same as the plane\'s native depth. If depth is None and this
            method is called from outside a Python COP, the depth will be
            hou.imageDepth.Float32. Otherwise, if depth is a hou.imageDepth
            enumerated value the result will be converted to the specified
            depth.

            See hou.Cop2Node.allPixels for more information. See also
            hou.Volume.setVoxelSliceFromString.

            Raises hou.OperationFailed if the time argument is set to a value
            greater than or equal to 0.0 and allPixelsAsString is called from a
            cooking Python COP.

        setPixelsOfCookingPlane(self, values, component=None, interleaved=True,

            Set the pixels of the plane being cooked by the currently-running
            Python COP.


            values
                A sequence of floats, organized with the contents of the bottom
                scanline first.

                If component is None, the length of the sequence of floats must
                be the number of pixels in the image times the number of
                components. Otherwise, it must be the number of pixels in the
                image.

            component
                Either the name of one component in the plane being cooked, or
                None. If a component name is given, values will contain only the
                values for that component. Otherwise, it will contain the values
                for all components of all pixels in the plane.

            interleaved
                If component is None and interleaved is True, values is contains
                the first component of the first pixel, followed by the second
                component of the first pixel, until the last component of the
                first pixel, then the first component of the second pixel, etc.
                If it is False, values contains all the values of the first
                component for all pixels, followed by all the values of the
                second component, etc.

                For example, if the plane is C and interleaved is True, the
                values will be organized as rgbrgbrgb.... If it is not
                interleaved, it will be organized as rrr...ggg...bbb....

                If component is not None, this parameter is ignored.

            flip_vertically
                The default value for this parameter is False, so the first
                scanline in the values array is assumed to be the bottom
                scanline. If flip_vertically is True, the input values are
                assumed to oriented starting at the top scanline.

            If you call this method from outside the cook function in a Python
            COP, raises hou.OperationFailed.

            can receive any Python object that supports the buffer interface. In
            particular, arrays from the array and numpy Python modules are
            supported, so there is no need to first construct strings from those
            arrays.

            stage
                The USD stage to modify.

            selection_rule
                A hou.LopSelectionRule specifying the SkelRoot instances the
                procedural should be applied to.

            camera_path
                A path to a Camera primitive in the stage to use for evaluating
                LOD.

            resolution
                A pair of integers specifying the output image's resolution.

            lod_threshold
                The threshold at which the LOD optimization will be used. The
                default value of 1.0 means that the optimization will be used
                when tolerance between the agent poses is less than
                approximately 1 pixel. Lower values can eliminate deformed
                geometry differences which might still be noticeable depending
                on the scene, but make it less likely for the LOD optimization
                to trigger and may increase the render's memory footprint.

            offscreen_quality
                Scales the approximate size of the agent in screen space for
                agents that are not directly visible to the camera. Smaller
                values will make offscreen agents more likely to become an
                instance of another agent.

            optimize_identical_poses
                A boolean value indicating whether to instance the deformed
                geometry for agents with exactly the same pose (including
                foreground agents). In most scenarios it is rare for agents to
                have identical poses (due to randomizing clip speeds, time
                offsets, etc) so this can typically be disabled to eliminate
                unnecessary computation.

            bake_all_agents
                A boolean value indicating whether to generate deformed geometry
                for the remaining SkelRoot Primitives which did not become an
                instance or prototype. This can be useful if the deformed
                geometry is required for subsequent procedurals. Otherwise, the
                deformed point positions for these agents will be generated
                through Hydra at render time.

            frame
                The time sample to apply the procedural at.

            prototype_material
                The path to a material to apply to SkelRoot primitives whose
                deformed geometry became a prototype for background instances.

            instance_material
                The path to a material to apply to SkelRoot primitives which
                became an instance of another SkelRoot's deformed geometry.

            default_material
                The path to a material to apply to SkelRoot primitives which
                were not modified by the crowd procedural.

                A tuple of two floats specifying the width and height of the new
                window, respectively. If this value is an empty tuple, Houdini
                will choose a default size.

            python_panel_interface
                The name of the Python Panel interface to be displayed in the
                floating pane tab. Specifying the interface name additionally
                hides the Python Panel toolbar. If python_panel_interface is
                None or points to an interface that does not exist then the
                default Python Panel pane tab is displayed along with the
                toolbar.

                This argument is ignored if pane_tab_type is not set to
                hou.paneTabType.PythonPanel.

            immediate
                Open the window immediately to help setting the window position
                correctly.

            Also note that the floating panel containing the new pane tab does
            not contain any panes: calling hou.PaneTab.pane on the pane tab
            returns None, and calling hou.FloatingPanel.panes on its floating
            panel returns an empty tuple. See hou.FloatingPanel for more
            information on these stripped down floating panels.

            See also hou.Desktop.createFloatingPanel.

            Return the solver solver data corresponding to the currently running
            Python script solver DOP.

            A Python script solver DOP runs in two passes. During the first
            pass, it evaluates its node parameters and stores them in the solver
            data. During this pass, hou.dop.isScriptSolverRunning returns False
            and you can access a writable version of the script solver data with
            hou.DopNode.pythonSolverData. During the second pass the solver is
            invoked to actually solve the objects. During this pass,
            hou.dop.isScriptSolverRunning returns True and you use this function
            to access a read-only version of the script solver data. You can
            access the objects being solved in this pass with
            hou.dop.scriptSolverNewObjects and hou.dop.scriptSolverObjects.

            DOP nodes attach data named Solver to each of the DOP objects being
            solved. If the only solver in use is the script solver, this data
            will be of type SIM_SolverScript. Otherwise, this data will be of
            type SIM_SolverMulti, and the SIM_SolverScript will be subdata of
            the multisolver data. This function provides an easy way of
            retrieving this data, regardless of where it exists.

            Typically, the solver data is shared between all the objects being
            solved. For this reason, the data returned by this function is read-
            only. Otherwise, if you modified this data, the DOP engine would

class Drawable:
    """

    hou.Drawable

    The base class for drawables.

    This class provides a common interface to all drawable classes.

    TIPS AND NOTES

      * Houdini supports various drawables such as hou.SimpleDrawable,
        hou.GeometryDrawable and hou.TextDrawable.

      * hou.SimpleDrawable and hou.GeometryDrawable represent extra geometry
        to draw in the viewer alongside user content (for example, as guide
        geometry).

      * hou.SimpleDrawable is the most basic Houdini drawable class, it is
        easy to use as you just need to attach a geometry, enable it and
        Houdini will take care of drawing the geometry.

      * hou.GeometryDrawable, hou.GadgetDrawable and
        hou.GeometryDrawableGroup also draw guide geometries but provide an
        API with advanced drawing capabilities.

      * hou.GadgetDrawable is similar to hou.GeometryDrawable but also
        allows you to identify located and picked geometries.

      * hou.TextDrawable draws text in the viewport.

      * Drawables are mostly used with custom python states, you will
        generally store a reference to drawable objects on the state
        implementation object.

      * When you create a drawable object, it is hidden. You need to call
        show(True) for the attached element to appear. hou.SimpleDrawable
        requires an extra call to hou.SimpleDrawable.enable for the geometry
        to appear.

      * The drawable element will appear in the viewer until the drawable
        object is hidden or deleted. If there are no references to the
        object, Python will automatically delete it during garbage
        collection, and the attached element will disappear. So, you need to
        make sure to keep a live reference to the object as long as you want
        it to appear.

            Sets the parameters of the drawable. The settings will take effect
            in the viewport the next time hou.AdvancedDrawable.draw is called.


            params
                A dictionary of parameters for setting the drawable options.
                Each drawable type uses a specific set of parameters, detailed
                information can be found in the drawable derived class params
                documentation such as GeometryDrawable and TextDrawable.

                The following are parameters common to all hou.AdvancedDrawable
                types:

                color1
                hou.Vector4

                Vector representing an rgba value used as the main color of a
                drawable. This color is multiplied by the overlay stencil colors
                at the time of compositing. The default value is hou.Vector4(1,
                1, 1, 1).

                For hou.TextDrawable, color1 is the default foreground color for
                drawing the text.

                color2
                hou.Vector4

                Vector representing an rgba value for setting the glow color
                around the drawable generated matte. Defaults to hou.Vector4(0,
                0, 0, 0.25).

                For instance, color2 can be used for drawing a glow around the
                generated matte for a face or point drawable.

                fade_factor
                double

                Value used as the occlusion factor of the overlay in areas
                occluded by the existing geometry as determined by the depth
                buffer. A fade factor of 1.0 means no distinction must be made
                and a value of 0.0 completely hides occluded parts. Defaults to
                0.

                glow_width
                int

                Sets the glow width value. For instance, this changes the glow
                width of line segments or text. Defaults to 0.

                highlight_mode
                hou.drawableHighlightMode

                Sets the mode for highlighting the generated matte of the
                drawable. Defaults to hou.drawableHighlightMode.Matte.

                translate
                hou.Vector3 or sequence of 3 doubles

                Position of the geometry in 3D space.

                For hou.TextDrawable, it's the position of the text to display
                in viewport coordinates.

                Defaults to hou.Vector3(0, 0, 0).

                rotation
                hou.Vector3 or sequence of 3 doubles

                Rotation vector in degrees. Defaults to hou.Vector3(0, 0, 0).

                scale
                hou.Vector3 or sequence of 3 doubles

                Scaling vector. Defaults to hou.Vector3(1, 1, 1).

                screen_space
                Sequence of doubles or ints

                Assigns a 2D window to the viewport, in viewport coordinates,
                for drawing a geometry. The sequence defines the location and
                size of the window, and must contain the following values:

              * X position (defaults to 0)

              * Y position (defaults to 0)

              * Width (defaults to 0)

              * Height (defaults to 0)

              * X margin (defaults to 0)

              * Y margin (defaults to 0)

                use_cd
                Bool

                Specifies if the drawable should use the Cd attribute of the
                attached geometry (if any). If an Alpha attribute exists, the
                drawable will use it as well. Defaults to True.

                use_uv
                Bool

                Specifies if the drawable should use the Uv attribute of the
                attached geometry (if any). Defaults to True.

    def draw(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """

        draw(self, handle, params=None)

            the python state onDraw or onDrawInterrupt event to render the
            drawable in the current viewport.


            handle
                This is an opaque value created by Houdini to render the

    hou.SimpleDrawable

    Represents extra geometry to draw in the viewer alongside user content
    (for example, as guide geometry).

    OVERVIEW

        You can attach geometry to a viewer in a Drawable object, causing
        the geometry to appear in the viewer even though the geometry is not
        actually part of the scene. This is useful to show guide geometry in
        a custom Python state.

        hou.SimpleDrawable basic support is ideal for simple guide
        geometries. For an advanced API for creating and drawing guide
        geometries, see hou.GeometryDrawable and hou.GeometryDrawableGroup.

    TIPS AND NOTES

      * The SimpleDrawable object keeps a reference to the Geometry object
        you pass. You can change the Geometry object\'s contents and the next
        time the viewer redraws it will draw the new contents.

      * When you create the SimpleDrawable object, it is disabled and
        hidden. You need to call enable(True) and then show(True) for the
        geometry to appear.

      * Even after they are activated and shown, SimpleDrawable geometry
        does not appear in the viewer until the next redraw (for example,
        when the user changes the view).

            You can force an individual viewport to redraw using
            hou.GeometryViewport.draw.

          > scene_viewer.curViewport().draw()

      * You can generate the contents of a Geometry object from scratch
        using verbs, or grab a copy of the output of a SOP node using
        hou.SopNode.geometry.

      * You can also use hou.drawablePrimitive to specify a built-in shape
        to generate the content of a SimpleDrawable object.

      * enabling/disabling a drawable may cause performances issues if
        performed too often, especially with large geometries. It\'s good
        practice to use show instead of enable for hiding and showing a
        drawable.

      * It\'s also good practice to disable drawables when they are not
        actively used in a viewer.

      * Add a Vertex or Point uv attribute to the hou.SimpleDrawable
        geometry to draw in the UV view:

          > sops = hou.sopNodeTypeCategory()        
          > verb = sops.nodeVerb(\\"sphere\\")
          > verb.setParms(parms)
          > geo = hou.Geometry()
          > verb.execute(geo, [])
          > 
          > # add uv vertex attribute to the drawable.
          > geo.addAttrib(hou.attribType.Vertex, \\"uv\\", (0,0))            
          > 
          > # add color and alpha attributes
          > color_attrib = geo.addAttrib(hou.attribType.Prim, \\"Cd\\", (1.0, 1.0, 1.0))
          > for prim in geo.prims():
          >     prim.setAttribValue(color_attrib, StrokeCursor.COLOR.rgb())
          > 
          > # create a wireframe brush
          > brush = hou.SimpleDrawable(self.scene_viewer, geo, \'%s_%s\' % (self.state_name, \\"sphere\\"))
          > brush.setDisplayMode(hou.drawableDisplayMode.WireframeMode)

    hou.FloatingPanel

    A floating window that contains one or more panes.

    Much like a desktop, a floating panel contains panes. A floating panel
    may be attached to a desktop, in which case it is saved with the
    desktop, hidden when the desktop is closed, and shown when the desktop
    is opened. You can use floating panels to create desktops that span
    multiple monitors.

    When you create a new floating panel, for example, it contains a single
    pane, which in turn contains a single pane tab showing the network
    editor.

    Note that a floating panel may be locked to one particular pane tab.
    These stripped down panels do not display the interface for adding new
    pane tabs or splitting panes. In fact, these stripped down floating
    panels do not contain any panes at all, and hou.FloatingPanel.panes will
    return an empty tuple. You can create such a stripped down floating
    panel with hou.Desktop.createFloatingPaneTab.

    See hou.Desktop for more information about panes and pane tabs.

class FolderParmTemplate(ParmTemplate):

    hou.FolderParmTemplate

    Describes a folder in a parameter dialog.

    Unlike all other hou.ParmTemplate subclasses, a folder does not
    correspond to an individual hou.ParmTuple. Instead, the set of adjacent
    folders form a folder set, and there is one parameter for this set that
    controls which folder is currently visible. These folder sets correspond
    to hou.FolderSetParmTemplate objects.

    Folder parm template objects are useful when manipulating the parameter
    interface of a node or a digital asset definition. Unlike folder set
    parm templates, they contain the parm templates inside the folder. They
    also let you add, remove, or hide an individual folder or move it from
    set one to another using hou.ParmTemplateGroup objects. Doing these
    individual folder-level operations is not possible with folder set parm
    templates.

    Note that folder parm templates are also used to represent multiparm
    blocks, much like the <Type Properties> dialog does. The folder parm
    template's hou.folderType determines whether it is a folder or a
    multiparm block. Unlike folder parm templates, which do not correspond
    directly to parameter instances, a multiparm parm template does
    correspond to an integer parameter that controls the number of instances
    of the multiparm.

            Create a new folder parm template.


            name
                The internal name of the parm template. Normally, parm template
                names correspond directly to parm tuples on nodes. However,
                because folder sets, not folders, correspond directly to parm
                tuples, the name used for the folder set parm tuple is the name
                of the first folder parm template in the set of adjacent folder
                parm templates.

            label
                The name of the folder that is displayed in the parameter
                dialog.

            parm_templates
                A sequence of hou.ParmTemplate subclass objects for the
                parameters inside the folder. Folders may be nested in other
                folders by putting FolderParmTemplates in this sequence.

            folder_type
                A hou.folderType enumerated value controlling whether the
                parameter is a folder or a multiparm block. This value controls
                the look of the folder/multiparm instance.

            is_hidden
                Whether or not this folder is hidden.

            ends_tab_group
                If True, this folder will be the last in the folder set, even if
                the next parameter is also a folder. In that case, the next
                parameter will begin a new folder set.

            tags
                A dictionary of extra information attached to the parm template.

            conditionals
                A dictionary that specifies conditionals (i.e. disable when,
                hide when) on the parameter template. For folder tab parameters
                these conditionals affect the entire folder set.

                The dictionary maps hou.parmCondType types to conditional
                strings.

                See the Conditionals section of the <Operator Type Properties
                window> help for more information on conditional strings.

            tab_conditionals
                A dictionary that specifies conditionals (i.e. disable when,
                hide when) on the parameter template. These conditionals affect
                only the folder tab generated by this parameter template and not
                the entire folder set.

                The dictionary maps hou.parmCondType types to conditional
                strings.

                See the Conditionals section of the <Operator Type Properties
                window> help for more information on conditional strings.

                hou.OperationFailed is raised if tab conditionals are specified
                for multi-parameter templates or import blocks.

    hou.GalleryEntry

    A gallery entry that can be applied to operator nodes to set their
    parameters to predefined values.

    A gallery entry is an entity containing data about an operator node
    setup. It has information about the node\'s parameter values, any
    additional spare parameters, channels, and for subnet nodes the
    information about the children, etc. Thus, a gallery entry is like a
    node template or a parameter preset. Such templates can be created from
    and applied to existing nodes.

    A gallery entry is identified by a unique, and has a non-unique label,
    and is usually associated with a specific hou.NodeType (or several node
    types) of the nodes to which it applies. In addition to the node
    information, gallery entries can have own categories that organize them
    into manageable sets and also can have keywords that identify their
    purpose. For more information about gallery entries, please see a
    gallery entry editor.

    In order for your gallery entries to appear in the Material Palette
    pane, they must satisfy two conditions. First, the node category must be
    set to indicate the gallery entry creates a SHOP node. Use code like:

    > hou.galleries.galleryEntries(\\"entry_name\\")[0].setNodeTypeCategory(hou.shopNodeTypeCategory())

    The second condition is that the entry must contain one or more keywords
    that indicate what renderer the SHOP works with. This affects whether
    the gallery entry appears when a specific renderer is chosen in the
    Material Palette renderer menu. Even if All is chosen in that menu, the
    gallery entry must contain a keyword that matches one of the renderers
    that appears in that menu. To associate a gallery entry with the Mantra
    renderer, do the following:

    > hou.galleries.galleryEntries(\\"entry_name\\")[0].setKeywords((\'Mantra\',))

    In HOM the gallery entries can be managed using hou.Gallery.

class Geometry:
    """

    hou.Geometry

    A Geometry object contains the points and primitives that define a 3D
    geometric shape. For example, each SOP node in Houdini generates a
    single Geometry object.

    If you ask a SOP for its geometry via hou.SopNode.geometry, you'll get a
    read-only reference to it. If the SOP recooks, the corresponding
    Geometry object will update to the SOP's new geometry. If the SOP is
    deleted, accessing the Geometry object will raise a hou.ObjectWasDeleted
    exception. If you call methods that try to modify the geometry, they
    will raise a hou.GeometryPermissionError exception.


    NOTE
        Whenever you call a method on a hou.Geometry object, Houdini will
        first attempt to acquire a handle to the underlying geometry. When
        working with read-only references to geometry on a SOP node, if the
        SOP in question fails to cook after the read-only reference has been
        assigned to a variable then any calls to methods on that variable
        will throw a hou.InvalidGeometry exception. If you receive this
        exception, your read-only reference is still 'live' and so methods
        on it will be accessible when the node errors are resolved, until
        then your code should handle this exception to avoid getting further
        errors. See hou.Geometry.isValid

    If you do not want the geometry to update when the SOP recooks, you can
    call hou.Geometry.freeze. freeze returns another Geometry object that
    will not change when the SOP recooks. Accessing frozen Geometry is
    slightly faster, since Houdini does not need to look up the SOP node for
    each access, so you may want to use frozen geometry for speed-crucial
    operations.

    If you're writing a SOP using Python, you will have read-write access to
    the geometry, and it will be frozen. To create a Python-defined SOP,
    select File > New Operator Type... and place the Python code in the Code
    tab.

    Finally, you can allocate a new frozen geometry with read-write access
    by creating an instance of hou.Geometry.

    GEOMETRY MODIFICATION

        Since Houdini 18, modifying geometry outside of cooking that is then
        passed into other HOM methods requires a corresponding increment of
        the appropriate data ids as well as incrementing the modification
        counter. This is especially important if you pass this geometry to
        be processed such as hou.SopVerb.execute since it uses data id
        optimizations. The simplest way to do this is to call
        hou.Geometry.incrementAllDataIds. However, a fine-grained list of
        methods can used to obtain the best performance:
        hou.Geometry.incrementDataIdsForAddOrRemove,
        hou.Geometry.incrementPrimitiveIntrinsicsDataId,
        hou.Geometry.incrementTopologyDataId, hou.Attrib.incrementDataId,
        hou.PointGroup.incrementDataId, hou.PrimGroup.incrementDataId,
        hou.EdgeGroup.incrementDataId, hou.VertexGroup.incrementDataId,
        hou.Geometry.incrementModificationCounter.

        When modifying geometry while inside a SOP, all data ids are
        automatically incremented, as well as the geometry change counter.
        To opt out of automatic data ids incrementing, call
        hou.SopNode.setManagesAttribDataIds with True. Note that you cannot
        opt out of incrementing the geometry change counter, it must be
        always done whenever a SOP node cooks. When unsure, it is better to
        leave hou.SopNode.managesAttribDataIds to the default False or else
        there is a risk that users of the output geometry (eg. the viewport)
        will fail to update when the geometry has changed.

            Return another Geometry object that is not linked to a particular
            SOP.

            Normally, when you call hou.SopNode.geometry, the resultant Geometry
            object retains a reference to that SOP, and is said to be unfrozen.
            Each time you access points, primitives, attributes, etc. in an
            unfrozen Geometry object, Houdini uses the SOP's latest cooked
            geometry. So, if you change parameters or change the time for an
            animated SOP, the Geometry object will update to the SOP's new
            geometry.

            Unless Python SOPs are involved, a frozen Geometry object does not
            have a similar live association with a particular SOP. If you ask a
            SOP for its geometry and then store a frozen copy of that geometry,
            when the SOP recooks the frozen Geometry object will not update.
            Instead, the frozen geometry saves its own copy of the point and
            primitive data, and is unaffected by subsequent changes to the SOP.
            When a frozen Geometry object is destroyed, any geometry copy it
            created is also destroyed.

            Note that accessing a Geometry object's points, primitives,
            attributes, etc. may be faster when dealing with frozen objects. You
            may want to work with frozen Geometry in speed-sensitive operations.

            Calling this method on an unfrozen Geometry object returns a frozen
            one. Calling it on a frozen object has no effect, and it returns a
            frozen object.

            When a Python-defined SOP cooks and runs Python code that asks for
            the SOP's geometry, the returned Geometry object is writable.
            Modifying this Geometry object affects the output of this SOP. For
            efficiency, this geometry object is already frozen, so calling
            freeze on it has no effect.


            read_only
                If True, the resulting frozen geometry will be read-only. Use
                read-only frozen geometry to share embedded geometry among
                multiple packed primitives.

            clone_data_ids
                If the conditions of this method causes a copy of the geometry
                to be made, then this specifies whether the new copy will have
                the same data ids. This is useful to enable optimizations that
                cache data by only looking at the attribute data id regardless
                of whether it is from the same geometry object or not.
                Otherwise, the new copy will have data ids that are unique.

            num_vertices
                The number of verticies in the curve. A new point is added to
                the geometry for each vertex, and this point is located at the
                origin until you change its position. You can also add more
                vertices with hou.Face.addVertex.

                The minimum number of vertices for a NURBS curve is identical to
                its order. So for the default order of 4, the curve must have a
                minimum of 4 vertices. If you specify too few vertices, this
                method raises hou.OperationFailed.

                Controls if the curve is open or closed; see hou.Face.isClosed

                open. This behavior is different from
                hou.Geometry.createPolygon, where the new polygon is closed. You
                can also open or close it with hou.Face.setIsClosed.

            order
                Specifies the curve's order. The default order is 4,

        createBezierCurve(num_points: 'int' = 4, is_closed: 'bool' = False,

            Create a new Bezier curve with the specified number of vertices and
            return it. You would typically call this method from the code of a
            Python-defined SOP.


            num_vertices
                The number of verticies in the curve. A new point is added to
                the geometry for each vertex, and this point is located at the
                origin until you change its position. You can also add more
                vertices with hou.Face.addVertex.

            is_closed
                Controls if the curve is open or closed; see hou.Face.isClosed
                for more information. If not specified, the resulting curve is
                open. This behavior is different from
                hou.Geometry.createPolygon, where the new polygon is closed.

            order
                Specifies the curve's order. The default order is 4,
                corresponding to a cubic Bezier curve. An order of 2, the lowest
                order, will give a curve with linear segments.

            An open Bezier curve must have (order - 1) * n + 1 vertices for some
            integer n>=1 (so valid values for order 4 curves are 4, 7, 10,
            etc.). A closed Bezier curve must have (order - 1) * n vertices
            (e.g. 3, 6, 9, etc. for order 4 curve). This restriction does not
            apply to curves of order 2, however.

            As a consequence, you cannot use hou.Face.setIsClosed on non-linear
            Bezier curves, since the number of vertices would need to change.

            Python-defined SOP.


            type
                A hou.attribType value to specify if the new attribute should be
                a point, primitive, vertex, or global attribute.

            name
                The new attribute\'s name. Each attribute in the geometry must
                have a unique name.

            default_value
                The default value for this attribute. When an attribute is
                created, all existing elements (e.g. primitives or points) will
                store this value. As well, elements that you add later will also
                use this value.

                This value also determines the attribute\'s data type.

                You can use one of the following Python types:

              * int

              * float

              * str

              * sequence (generator, iterator, list, or tuple) of int

              * sequence of str

              * dict

              * sequence of dict

                If the default value is a sequence of integers or floats, the
                sequence size will determine the attribute\'s size. Otherwise,
                the attribute\'s size is 1.

                String attributes do not support a default value and use this
                value solely for type determination.

            transform_as_normal
                This parameter may only be set to True when the default value is
                a sequence of 3 floats. For such attributes, Houdini will not
                modify the attribute values when it transforms (translates,
                rotates, etc.) the geometry. If you want to the attribute to be
                transformed as a vector (such as a normal vector) when Houdini
                transforms the geometry, set this parameter to True.

            create_local_variable
                If True, Houdini will create a local variable for this attribute
                that may be used in parameter expressions. The name of the local
                variable is the attribute\'s name, all in upper case. The mapping
                from attribute names to local variables is stored in a special
                global attribute named \\"varmap\\".

            Raises hou.GeometryPermissionError if this geometry is not
            modifiable.

            Raises hou.OperationFailed if an attribute with this name already
            exists. If you are familiar with the C++ Houdini Development Kit
            (HDK), you know that Houdini can support attributes with the same
            name but with different types. However, many SOPs do not let you
            distinguish between attributes that have the same name, and multiple

            Determines the intersection point of a ray with the geometry in this
            object.


            NOTE
                This method is unusual in that instead of returning multiple
                pieces of information about the intersection, it requires that
                you pass it objects which it modifies in-place with the
                information.

            Returns the ID number of the hit primitive if the ray intersected
            the geometry, or -1 if the ray did not hit.


            ray_origin
                A hou.Vector3 object representing the starting point of the ray
                in world space.

            ray_direction
                A hou.Vector3 object representing the direction vector of the
                ray.

            position_out
                Pass a hou.Vector3 object to this argument. The method will
                change the object\'s values to represent the intersection
                position in world space.

            normal_out
                Pass a hou.Vector3 object to this argument. The method will
                change the object\'s values to represent the normal direction
                from the surface to the ray.

            uvw_out
                Pass a hou.Vector3 object to this argument. The method will
                change the object\'s values to represent the UVW position within
                the intersecting primitive where the ray hit.

            pattern
                If you pass a string containing primitive group syntax, the ray
                can only intersect primitives that match the pattern.

            min_hit
                Ignore intersections closer than this distance. You can use the
                min_hit argument to iterate through all possible hits along the
                ray, by setting the min_hit a tiny bit farther than the previous
                hit.

              > hit_positions = []
              > prev_dist = 0.01
              > while geometry.intersect(origin, direction, position, normal, uvw,
              >                          min_hit=prev_dist):
              >     # Make sure to store a *copy* of the position, not the object
              >     # that is being modified in each iteration of the loop
              >     hit_positions.append(hou.Vector3(position))
              >     prev_dist = origin.distanceTo(position) + 0.01

            max_hit
                Ignore intersections farther than this distance.

            tolerance
                Use this parameter to adjust the accuracy of intersections. If
                the ray approaches the geometry within the tolerance value, an
                intersection hit is assumed. A 0.01 tolerance (default) gives
                strict intersections while larger values produces less accurate
                intersections.

            edges provided in the edges parameter. If multiple paths are being
            returned, they will be separated in the single returned tuple by a
            value of None. The paths are generated using the same algorithm used
            when performing loop selections in the viewport.

            edges: A list of hou.Edge objects that define the path or paths of
            connected edges this function should return. Must contain at least
            one or two edges depending on the loop options.

            loop_type: Controls the type of path returned. Can be any of the
            hou.componentLoopType values. If using either the
            hou.componentLoopType.Extended or hou.componentLoopType.Closed loop
            types, the inputs edges cannot contain any None entries. If these
            conditions are not met, a hou.OperationFailed exception will be
            thrown.

            full_loop_per_edge: If set to True, with the loop_type set to
            hou.componentLoopType.Extended or hou.componentLoopType.Closed loop
            types, each inputs edge is used to create its own full loop or ring.
            If False, the edges are taken in pairs, and so the number of edges
            must be even.

            force_ring: If set to True, this function will return edge rings
            instead of edge loops.

            allow_ring: If set to True, this function may return an edge ring if
            the edges provided produce a ring more naturally than they produce a
            loop (for example if two perpendicular edges are provided from the
            same row on a polygonal grid). If set to False, only edge loops will
            be returned.

            Raises a hou.OperationFailed if it was unable to construct a loop
            from the desired components.

    Advanced drawable for drawing guide geometries.

    OVERVIEW

        hou.GeometryDrawable lets you draw guide geometries like
        hou.SimpleDrawable, but offers more drawing options with various
        kind of visualization effects. For instance, you can use a
        hou.GeometryDrawable object for drawing the faces of the attached
        geometry, drawing points in different shapes, drawing lines or
        vectors. You may also use a glow matte effect to highlight faces,
        lines, point radius, etc...

        Like hou.SimpleDrawable, hou.GeometryDrawable uses mostly the same
        services for managing geometries in the viewer without being part of
        the actual scene. Like hou.TextDrawable, hou.GeometryDrawable is
        designed for python states and requires the onDraw handler for
        drawing its attached geometry.


        NOTE
            hou.GeometryDrawable can only be used with polygon mesh
            geometries.

                Other common parameters are listed in
                hou.AdvancedDrawable.setParams.

                clip_plane
                hou.Vector4 or sequence of 4 doubles

                Vector representing a clip plane in world coordinates. (a, b, c,
                d) represents a plane ax + by + cz + d = 0, and geometry behind
                the plane is clipped. The default value is hou.Vector4(0, 0, 0,
                0). Setting this param also enables the use of clip plane on
                this drawable. This can be enabled/disabled with useClipPlane.

                Line parameter
                Type
                Description
                line_width
                double

                Sets the line width value. Defaults to 1.0.

                style
                hou.drawableGeometryLineStyle or sequence of 2 doubles

                Sets the line style to draw: solid, dashed, or dotted. When
                passing in 2 doubles, the first value is the length of the dash
                in pixels and the second is the length of the gap between dashes
                in pixels. Defaults to hou.drawableGeometryLineStyle.Plain.

                Type
                Description
                backface_culling
                Bool

                Enable or disable backface culling. Defaults to the current
                viewport Remove Backfaces display option.

                color_ramp_parm
                hou.Parm

                Sets the drawable with a color ramp object. If the ramp is
                enabled (i.e. use_ramp_color=True), the drawable hilites the
                geometry polygons with the ramp value settings along with a pre-
                existing Cd attribute on the geometry. Defaults to an RGB ramp
                object type.

                The ramp works as a transformation on values from the Cd. It's
                done per component, so, if your Cd doesn't have the same value
                in all the three components, you won't get the colors from the
                ramp.

                The way it works is that the ramp ends up being a 1-dimensional
                OpenGL texture (512 pixels long). The drawable takes each
                component (R, G, B) of each fragment color and maps it linearly
                (using the ramp_range min and max values) into an index in
                (0...511) and reads off the corresponding color component from
                the texture and substitutes the Cd value with that value for
                that component.

                If the value ends up out of min-max range, then depending on the
                ramp_clamp setting it either gets clamped to one of the two ends
                of the range, or is taken modulo the range interval (repeating
                cyclically), or is just blacked out.

                glyphe_scale
                double

                A scale value for the face patterns. Default to 1.0.

                indices
                sequence of int

                A list of indices representing the geometry faces to draw. All
                geometry faces are drawn by default.

                period
                double

                A value for displaying faces in patterns based on the style
                option selected. Defaults to 0.

                style
                hou.drawableGeometryFaceStyle

                Sets the face style to draw. Defaults to

    OVERVIEW

        hou.GeometryDrawableGroup acts as a regular hou.GeometryDrawable
        object which can contain several hou.GeometryDrawable children.
        hou.GeometryDrawableGroup performs operations on its children in the
        order they were added. You can also query specific children from
        hou.GeometryDrawableGroup for setting their parameters individually.

        Here\'s an example that creates a group composed of two
        hou.GeometryDrawable objects.

                This method is unusual in that instead of returning multiple

class GeometryViewport:
    '''

    hou.GeometryViewport

    A viewport within a Scene Viewer pane, for viewing the scene at the
    Object or SOP level.

    OVERVIEW

        A viewer is a type of pane that shows the scene. The viewer\'s
        contents is conceptually divided into viewports. By default, the
        scene viewer shows a single viewport, the Perspective view. However,
        you can use the view layout controls to, for example, split the view
        into four viewports (Perspective, Top, Front, and Right views).
        Viewports are the parts of the interface that actually display the
        scene to the user.


            To access a viewport, you must first get a reference to a Scene
            Viewer pane tab. See the following methods:


            hou.ui.paneTabOfType
                Use hou.ui.paneTabOfType(hou.paneTabType.SceneViewer) to get
                a reference to a Scene Viewer pane tab in the current pane
                layout. If the current layout has no Scene Viewer pane tab,
                this returns None.

                To be more precise about which viewer you grab in a possible
                multi-viewer layout, see also hou.ui.curDesktop to get a
                hou.Desktop object representing the current pane layout, and
                hou.Desktop.sceneViewers to get a list of scene viewer pane
                tabs in the current layout.

            Once you have a reference to a hou.SceneViewer pane object, you
            can use it to access the viewer pane\'s viewport or viewports.
            See the following methods:


            hou.SceneViewer.viewports
                Returns a list of the viewports in the viewer pane.

            hou.SceneViewer.findViewport
                Gets a single viewport by name, for example \\"Top\\".

            hou.SceneViewer.selectedViewport
                Gets the currently selected viewport. The user can select a
                viewport by pressing [Space + N] in the viewport. The view
                menus in the upper right corner are drawn brighter in the
                selected viewport.

            possible to enable this without the viewport looking through a
            camera, though view changes will not affect any objects until the
            user sets the viewport to look through a camera or light.

    hou.GeometryViewportDisplaySet

    A Display Set represents a group of 3D viewport display options that
    apply to a particular context of geometry.

    OVERVIEW

        In Houdini's 3D viewer display options window, you can apply
        different display options to certain subsets of objects/geometry,
        for example selected objects, or the displayed SOP. This object
        represents a set of options that apply to one of these subsets. For
        example, you can set templated SOPs to display as wireframe:

      > # Get a reference to the geometry viewer
      > pane = hou.ui.curDesktop().paneTabOfType(hou.paneTabType.SceneViewer)
      > 
      > # Get the display settings
      > settings = pane.curViewport().settings()
      > 
      > # Get the GeometryViewportDisplaySet for objects
      > tmplset = settings.displaySet(hou.displaySetType.TemplateModel)
      > 
      > # Tell Houdini to show set the shading mode for this subset to wireframe
      > tmplset.setShadedMode(hou.glShadingType.Wire)

        There are several subsets available:

        Objects

        hou.displaySetType.SceneObject
            Object nodes which are not selected or ghosted.

        hou.displaySetType.SelectedObject
            Object nodes which are selected.

        hou.displaySetType.GhostObject
            Object nodes which ghosted, which occurs when they are visible
            when at the SOP level and Ghost Other Objects is the current
            object mode, but are not the current object.

        Geometry

        hou.displaySetType.DisplayModel
            SOP with the display flag. This takes precedence over
            TemplateModel and CurrentModel, if the SOP has either the
            template flag set or is selected.

        hou.displaySetType.CurrentModel
            SOP that is currently selected. This takes precedence over
            TemplateModel, if that SOP also has the template flag set.

        hou.displaySetType.TemplateModel
            SOP that has a template flag set.

        You can set the options in each display set independently of the
        other sets. You can also link a subset to another, so this subset
        uses the linked set's options.

    hou.GeometryViewportSettings

    A collection of settings controlling a viewport\'s view of the scene
    (such as the view angle and whether different guides are displayed).
    Many of this object\'s methods correspond to settings in the Display
    Options dialog.

    OVERVIEW


            To access a viewport, you must first get a reference to a Scene
            Viewer pane tab. See the following methods:


            hou.ui.paneTabOfType
                Use hou.ui.paneTabOfType(hou.paneTabType.SceneViewer) to get
                a reference to a Scene Viewer pane tab in the current pane
                layout. If the current layout has no Scene Viewer pane tab,
                this returns None.

                To be more precise about which viewer you grab in a possible
                multi-viewer layout, see also hou.ui.curDesktop to get a
                hou.Desktop object representing the current pane layout, and
                hou.Desktop.sceneViewers to get a list of scene viewer pane
                tabs in the current layout.

            Once you have a reference to a hou.SceneViewer pane object, you
            can use it to access the viewer pane\'s viewport or viewports.
            See the following methods:


            hou.SceneViewer.viewports
                Returns a list of the viewports in the viewer pane.

            hou.SceneViewer.findViewport
                Gets a single viewport by name, for example \\"Top\\".

            hou.SceneViewer.selectedViewport
                Gets the currently selected viewport. The user can select a
                viewport by pressing [Space + N] in the viewport. The view
                menus in the upper right corner are drawn brighter in the
                selected viewport.

        You can then get a GeometryViewportSettings object for the viewport
        by calling hou.GeometryViewport.settings.


        TIP
            Some of the more commonly-used methods, such as setting the view
            to look through a camera, are duplicated on the
            hou.GeometryViewport object for convenience.

            its handle to get updated. For dynamic handles, this will trigger a

                performed immediately. Defaults to False.

                When Houdini starts up it reads all the OPlibraries files it
                finds in the Houdini path and loads all the hda files listed in
                them. By creating OPlibraries files in $HOME/houdiniX.Y,
                $HSITE/houdiniX.Y, $JOB, etc. you can create libraries that are
                specific to a particular user, studio, job, etc.

                Note that OPlibraries are only used when the Use OPlibraries
                files to find HDAS checkbox in the Configuration tab of the
                Operator Type Manager is checked.

                If None or Current HIP File, the hda file is loaded only into
                the current Houdini session. The file name will also be saved in
                the Hip file so that when the same Hip file is loaded, the hda
                file will also be loaded automatically.

                If Scanned Asset Library Directories, this is equivalent to the
                installation menu entry in the Install Digital Asset Library

                current. See hou.HDADefinition.isPreferred for more information.

            Note that, if you do not store the path to the hda file in an
            OPlibraries file, Houdini will store it in the current Houdini
            session. So, when you load a hip file, it will try to load the hda

            Register a Python callback that Houdini will call whenever a

            Callbacks only persist for the current session. For example, they
            are not saved to the .hip file. If you want persistent callbacks in
            every session, you can add them in code in pythonrc.py (runs on
            startup) or 456.py (runs when the user opens a .hip file). See where
            to add Python scripting for more information.


            event_types
                A sequence of hou.hdaEventType enumeration values describing the
                event types that will cause Houdini to call the callback
                function.

            callback
                A callable Python object, such as a function or bound method.
                Houdini will call this function whenever one of the event types
                in event_types occurs.

                Houdini calls the function with an event_type keyword argument
                containing the hou.hdaEventType value corresponding to the event
                that triggered the callback.

                Houdini will pass additional keyword arguments depending on the
                event type. For example, in a callback for the LibraryInstalled
                or LibraryUninstalled events, Houdini will pass a library_path
                keyword argument containing the path of the .hda file that was
                installed or uninstalled. See hou.hdaEventType for the
                additional arguments passed for each event type.

                You can add **kwargs to the argument list to accept all keyword
                arguments, to allow the same callback to be used for different
                events, or to be safe from future changes:

              > def event_callback(event_type, **kwargs):
              >     ...

            NOTE
                If you try to add the exact same callback function more than
                once, Houdini will still only call the function only once in
                response to an event. However, it may be useful to add the same
                function if you want to register it with different event_types.

            Raises hou.OperationFailed if the event_types list argument is
            empty.

            The following example shows to set up a function that\'s called
            whenever a new asset is added to Houdini:

          > 
          > def hda_event(event_type, asset_definition, **kwargs):

    """

    hou.HDADefinition

    Represents the definition of a houdini digital asset (HDA).

    A digital asset definition defines a node type and exists inside an hda
    file. The node type is implemented in terms of other nodes wired
    together inside a subnet. These nodes inside the subnet are called the
    definition's contents.

    An hda file contains one or more digital asset definitions, and
    installing an hda file installs all the definitions in the file. When a
    digital asset definition is installed, the node type it defines is added
    to Houdini. Note that you can access an HDADefinition without installing
    it.

    A digital asset's algorithm is determined by the nodes inside it. To
    edit those nodes you create an instance of the digital asset, unlock it,
    modify the contents, and save the definition. New digital asset
    instances are normally locked, meaning that they are read-only, and they
    automatically update when the asset's definition changes. An unlocked
    instance is editable, does not update when the definition changes, and
    you can save its contents to change the definition.

    To unlock a node, select Allow Editing of Contents or call
    hou.OpNode.allowEditingOfContents. To save the contents of an unlocked
    node to the definition, select Save Operator Type or call
    hou.HDADefinition.updateFromNode. To revert an unlocked instance back to
    the last saved definition and change it back into a locked instance,
    select Match Current Definition or call
    hou.OpNode.matchCurrentDefinition.

class HDAModule:
    '''

    hou.HDAModule

    User-defined Python module containing functions, classes, and constants
    that are stored with and accessed from a digital asset.

    In Python, a module lets you organize functions, classes, and constants
    into a common namespace. For example, os is a module and os.getcwd is a
    function inside that module, and you access the contents of a module by
    looking up Python attributes on it.

    An HDAModule is a Python module that is associated with a particular
    digital asset type. It lets you store a library of Python code in one
    location in your asset, and you can invoke that code from parameters,
    event handlers, and callbacks inside that asset.

    The module\'s source code is stored in the Python Module section of the
    Scripts tab in the Type Properties dialog. For example, suppose the
    digit asset is an object named gear and the Python Module section
    contains the following:

    > def position():
    >     return (hou.frame() * 1.2, 0.0, 3.2)
    > 
    > def onButtonPress():
    >     print \\"you pressed the button\\"
    > 
    > def onLoaded():
    >     print \\"onLoaded section running\\"

    Unlike regular Python modules, which you access by name, you access a
    digital asset\'s Python module by calling hou.NodeType.hdaModule on its
    node type. For example, suppose you created an object-level digital
    asset named gear and put the above code in its Python Module section.
    You could then access the contents of the Python module as follows:

    > >>> node_type = hou.nodeType(hou.objNodeTypeCategory(), \\"gear\\")
    > >>> node_type.hdaModule().position()
    > (1.2, 0.0, 3.2)
    > >>> node_type.hdaModule().onButtonPress()
    > you pressed the button

    One use for the Python module is drive parameter expressions on nodes
    inside the digital asset. For example, suppose /obj/gear1 is an instance
    of the digital asset and /obj/gear1/geo1 is a node inside the asset. You
    could put the following inside geo1\'s tx parameter expression:

    > hou.node(\\"..\\").type().hdaModule().position()[0]

    For convenience, you can also access the module from a node instance of
    the digital asset using hou.OpNode.hdaModule. So, you could simplify the
    above expression to:

    > hou.node(\\"..\\").hdaModule().position()[0]

    And since you don\'t need to use the hou. prefix inside expressions, you
    could further simplify it to:

    > node(\\"..\\").hdaModule().position()[0]

    The following example shows how you might run code in the module from
    the Callback Script field of a button parameter:

    > hou.pwd().hdaModule().onButtonPress()

    In an event handler script, such as On Loaded, you can use the kwargs
    dict to access the node type:

    > kwargs[\\"type\\"].hdaModule().onLoaded()

    Note that Houdini creates a local kwargs dict that\'s accessible from the
    Python Module, too. It contains one entry with the key \\"type\\", to give
    you access to the hou.NodeType defined by the digital asset.

    If you find that a digital asset has too much Python code to store in
    one module, it\'s possible to create submodules. For example, if you want
    to create a submodule named bar, put its source code in a new digital
    asset section (say, \\"bar_PythonModule\\"). Then, from the Python Module
    section, you can write the following:

    > import toolutils
    > bar = toolutils.createModuleFromSection(\\"bar\\", kwargs[\\"type\\"], \\"bar_PythonModule\\")

    NOTE
        New to Houdini 18.0, the createModuleFromSection function expects
        the code in the HDA section to have Python 3 style print statements.

        In general this means that print statements in the HDA section must
        have the arguments enclosed in parentheses.


        For example
          > print(\\"Hello world!\\")
        instead of
          > print \\"Hello world!\\"
    bar now appears as a submodule of the main module. If, for example, the
    bar_PythonModule section contains:

    > def foo():
    >     return 3.2

    then you could write the following from a parameter on the digital asset
    node:

    > pwd().hdaModule().bar.foo()

    Note that the Python Module code is stored in a section of the digital
    asset named \\"PythonModule\\". For example, you can get a string containing
    that source code using
    node_type.definition().sections()[\\"PythonModule\\"].contents().

class HDASection:

    hou.HDASection

    Represents a section of data stored along with a digital asset.

    A digital asset stores its contents in a number of different pieces of
    data called sections. Each section is named and contains an arbitrarily
    sized piece of data, often textual. Each section is like a file embedded
    inside the definition, and Houdini uses specially named sections to
    store the node contents, list of parameters, etc. You can embed your own
    data into a digital asset by putting it inside a section.

    Any parameter in Houdini that references a file can also reference a
    section inside a digital asset. For example, if car is an object-level
    digital asset and the section is named \\"texture.jpg\\", you can reference
    that texture with opdef:/Object/car?texture.jpg. Note that hou.readFile
    also supports this opdef: syntax.

    By moving files into digital asset sections, you can build self-
    contained digital assets that can be distributed via a single hda file.

    Note that section names may contain \'/\'.

            Construct a new InterruptableOperation.


            operation_name
                A description of the interruptable operation that appears in the
                progress bar of the interrupt dialog.

            long_operation_name
                A description of the long, or higher-level, operation. If it is
                not None, a second progress bar appears on the interrupt dialog
                with the long operation name in it.

            open_interrupt_dialog
                Determines whether the interrupt dialog should appear or not.

            The constructor should only be called from within a with statement.
            For example:

          > with hou.InterruptableOperation(
          >         \\"Performing Tasks\\", open_interrupt_dialog=True) as operation:
          >     for i in num_tasks:
          >         #
          >         # PERFORM TASK HERE.
          >         #
          > 
          >         # Update operation progress.
          >         percent = float(i) / float(num_tasks)
          >         operation.updateProgress(percent)

            In Python 2.5, the with statement is not enabled by default. To
            enable it, you need to add the following line at the beginning of
            your script/module:

          > from __future__ import with_statement

            You can nest multiple interruptable operations. This is ideal when
            you have a long operation consisting of several smaller operations.
            For example:

          > # Start the overall, long operation.
          > with hou.InterruptableOperation(
          >         \\"Performing\\", \\"Performing Tasks\\",
          >         open_interrupt_dialog=True) as operation:
          >     for i in num_tasks:
          >         # Update long operation progress.
          >         overall_percent = float(i) / float(num_tasks)
          >         operation.updateLongProgress(overall_percent)
          > 
          >         # Start the sub-operation.
          >         with hou.InterruptableOperation(
          >                 \\"Performing Task %i\\" % i) as suboperation:

          >                 # Update sub-operation progress.

                A fractional number between 0.0 and 1.0. A value of 0.0 means
                that no progress has been made while 1.0 means that the
                operation is complete. A negative percentage indicates that the

    hou.IPRViewer

    An interactive preview render (IPR) window.

    view of the rendered image and eventually providing the fully rendered
    image. When you change a shader value, move an object, etc., the viewer
    will re-render the image.

    When you Ctrl+click on a pixel in the rendered image, Houdini searches
    $HOUDINI_PATH for scripts/ipr/pickpixel.py and runs it. The version of
    this file that ships with Houdini pops up the shader contributing the
    pixel, or an information window if there is is no shader. If Houdini
    cannot find that Python file it then looks for the Hscript file
    scripts/ipr/pickpixel.cmd.

    When you drag a SHOP node onto the rendered image, Houdini searches for
    and runs scripts/ipr/dragdrop.py. By default, this script assigns the
    SHOP to the object contributing the pixel. If it cannot find a Python

            You would typically call this method from a shelf script. For

    hou.logging

    Module containing functions and classes for logging warnings and errors.

    Houdini's logging system consists of sources and sinks. Sources generate
    and distribute log entries. Sinks receive log entries from sources, and
    do something with them. Sources are global, and identified by a unique
    name string (such as Node Errors which is a source that generates a log
    entry for every message, warning, or error generated by nodes). There
    can be any number of sinks created in a Houdini session, and each one
    can connect to a different set of sources. Thus you could create one
    sink that sends all node errors to a file, another sink that sends all
    rendering messages to a different file, and a third sink that captures
    in memory all log entries generated by any sink (the same source may be
    connected to multiple sinks). This system allows for fine grained
    control over which log entries are captured, and what is done with each
    log entry.

    Represents a logging destination that writes log entries to a file.

    This kind of sink can be used to send log entries to a file on disk.
    Some of the log entry details are lost in writing the data to disk, as
    each log entry is output simply as a time stamp followed by the message
    text. So for most situations, using the Log Viewer pane to investigate
    log entries will be preferable.


    Tip
        In order to ensure all logs are captured and committed to disk, this
        sink type opens the log file, writes the log entry, and closes the
        file for each log message. This can introduce noticeable performance
        issues if a large amount of information is being logged. Therefore
        it is strongly recommended that the destination file be local to the
        machine running Houdini, and preferably be kept on an SSD hard
        drive.

    hou.LopPostLayer

    Provides the ability to author post-layer data on a LOP Network.

    This object is used to define a with block in Python, which guarantees a
    well defined lifetime. Inside this block, this object provides access to
    an editable USD layer. When the block ends and this object is destroyed,
    the changes made to the USD layer are saved to the LOP Network, and any
    viewers pointed at nodes inside that LOP Network will be updated
    appropriately.

    This object is returned by a call to hou.LopNetwork.editablePostLayer.

    A post-layer is a concept within Solaris which allows USD layers to be
    added to the session layer of every LOP node's composed stage. These
    layers live outside the LOP node cook process, and so their content does
    not affect the operation of any LOP nodes. For example, primitives
    defined in a post-layer cannot be seen by any LOP nodes. But any request
    to access the stage of a LOP node will contain the content of these
    post-layers unless you specifically request that post-layers be excluded
    (using the apply_post_layers parameter in hou.LopNode.stage or turning
    off post layers in the Scene Viewer). Disabling post-layers should
    generally only be required when debugging the post-layer content.

    Because these are session layers, their opinions are stronger than any
    opinions authored by LOP nodes (which author opinions on the stage's
    root layer). Unlike Viewport Overrides, the content of these layers is
    also saved by the USD and USD Render ROPs, and so will affect final
    renders.

    Use cases for post-layers include the creation of standard primitives
    (like Render Settings) which should be available anywhere in the LOP
    Network. Another use case would be to apply a final pass to the scene
    graph data, such as disabling all materials for quick render tests. But
    since post-layers can only be authored by python code, integrating them
    into an artist's workflow will always require some custom user
    interface, though that interface may be as simple as providing
    checkboxes to turn certain post-layers on or off.

    hou.Matrix4

    A 4x4 matrix of floating point values.

    4x4 matrices are typically used in Houdini to represent a 3D
    transformation (e.g. some combination of rotation, scaling, shearing,
    and translation). A single matrix compactly represents a transformation,
    and is much easier to deal with than multiple translate, rotate, scale,
    shear, transformation order, and rotation order values.

    Note that Houdini's matrices are stored in row-major format, and vectors
    that are multiplied with matrices are treated as row vectors. So, if p
    is a hou.Vector4 representing a point and M is a Matrix4, you write p*M,
    not M*p. Similarly, p*M1*M2 will first transform p by M1, and then
    transform it by M2.


    NOTE
        Most mathematical notations treat vectors and points as column
        vectors instead of row vectors. They will often use A*B*C (or simply
        ABC) to refer to a combined transform that first applies C's
        transform, then B's, and then applies A's. However, the convention
        is different in Houdini. To represent the equivalent matrix
        expression in Houdini, you need to concatenate the transforms in the
        reverse order. So, you would instead write C'*B'*A', where C', B',
        A' are the transpose of C, B, A respectively.

    You can multiply Vector3s or Vector4s by Matrix4s. If you multiply a
    Vector3, it is the same as multiplying a Vector4 where the fourth
    component is 1 (see hou.Vector3.__mul__).

    To transform a normal (as opposed to a point or vector), you need to
    multiply by the inverse transpose of the matrix. For example, suppose:


    p
        is a hou.Vector3 object representing a position (or a hou.Vector4
        with p[3]==1)

    v
        is a hou.Vector4 object representing a vector (a direction with a
        length but no fixed location in space), with v[3]==0

    n
        is a hou.Vector4 object representing a normal, with v[3]==0

    m
        is a Matrix4 object representing a transform matrix

    Then you would write:

    > p * m # to transform the point
    > v * m # to transform the vector
    > n * m.inverted().transposed() # to transform the normal
    > # (note that m.inverted().transposed() is mathematically equivalent to m.transposed().inverted())

    Here is a concrete example:

    > >>> m = hou.hmath.buildTranslate((1, 1, 2))
    > >>> m
    > <hou.Matrix4 [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 2, 1]]>
    > >>> p = hou.Vector3(1, 2, 3)
    > >>> p * m
    > <hou.Vector3 [2, 3, 5]>

    Both VEX and the UT_DMatrix4 class in the Houdini Development Kit (HDK)
    also store matrices in row-major format.

            The rotation is returned as a set of Euler angles, in degrees. See

                For example, imagine a transformation where you first translate
                in x by one unit, then you rotate in z by 45 degrees. With a

                scaling, then rotating, and then translating. For this
                transformation order, the translate component would be (1.0 /
                math.sqrt(2), 1.0 / math.sqrt(2), 0).

                the coordinate axes.

            pivot
                A Vector3 containing a position about which rotations and scales
                are performed. By default, this parameter is set to the origin.

            pivot_rotate
                A Vector3 containing the Euler angles about the x, y, and z
                axes, in degrees, that specifies the base rotation about the
                pivot. These angles are always processed in 'xyz' order.

    hou.NetworkAnimValue

    A value to adjust the appearance of a network editor without changing
    the underlying node data.

    The hou.NetworkEditor pane allows network items to be moved or resized
    by user interactions without actually changing the node positions or
    sizes. This is accomplished by associating each NetworkAnimValue with a
    network item through the hou.NetworkEditor.setAdjustments method.
    NetworkAnimValues can either represent a single value, or they can
    represent an animation from one value to another. The actual animation
    is displayed automatically by the network editor.

    For example, to following code would animate the position of a couple of
    nodes:

    > >>> editor = hou.ui.paneTabOfType(hou.paneTabType.NetworkEditor)
    > >>> n1 = hou.node('/obj/geo1')
    > >>> pos1 = n1.position()
    > >>> newpos1 = pos1 + hou.Vector2(5, 5)
    > >>> anim1 = hou.NetworkAnimValue(1.0, pos1, newpos1)
    > >>> n2 = hou.node('/obj/geo2')
    > >>> pos2 = n2.position()
    > >>> newpos2 = pos2 + hou.Vector2(5, 5)
    > >>> anim2 = hou.NetworkAnimValue(1.0, pos2, newpos2)
    > >>> editor.setAdjustments([n1, n2], [anim1, anim2], auto_remove=True)
    > >>> n1.setPosition(newpos1)
    > >>> n2.setPosition(newpos2)

    Note that the new positions are set on the nodes immediately. But the
    animation starts them at their original positions, and makes it look
    like they move slowly to their new positions. Also note that the
    auto_remove parameter in the call to setAdjustments() has been set to
    True. This is because we are using the adjustments only to animate the
    nodes to their new positions, which have already been set. Once the
    animation is complete, the adjustments can be thrown away. Without this
    parameter, the adjustments would remain on the network editor until the
    next call the setAdjustments.

                A boolean value indicating whether the rect parameter describes
                the node shape size and position in screen space or network
                layout space. If set to True, the bounds are expressed as pixels

                bounds are expressed in network units.

            smooth
                A boolean value indicating whether lines should be drawn with
                smoothing turned on. Smoothing lines is a form of anti-aliasing
                which can make curved lines look better, but doing so may affect
                the color of the line. This parameter has no effect if fill is

class Bundle:
    '''

    hou.NodeBundle

    A named set of nodes whose contents can be from different networks. A
    bundle\'s contents may be fixed or may be determined from a pattern, and
    the contents may be filtered by node type.

    Unlike node groups, the nodes in a bundle may be from different node
    networks. For example, the same bundle may contain /obj/geo1 and
    /obj/subnet1/geo2. Node groups are primarily used to organize and
    display very large networks, while node bundles are normally used to
    track which objects are lit by a light, which objects are visible in a
    scene, etc.

    There are two types of node bundles: regular and smart. You can add and
    remove individual nodes to and from a regular bundle. The nodes in a
    smart bundle, on the other hand, are determined from a pattern stored in
    the bundle. As nodes matching the pattern are created or deleted in
    Houdini, the contents of the bundle will update automatically. You can
    use hou.NodeBundle.pattern to determine if the bundle is a smart bundle
    or a regular one.

    When a node matches the pattern in a smart bundle, that node and its
    children will be added to the bundle. For example, if the pattern in
    \\"/obj/*\\" and /obj/box_object1 is a geometry object, all the nodes inside
    /obj/box_object1 will be added to the bundle, recursively. Carets (^) in
    the pattern can be used to remove nodes; for example, \\"/obj/*
    ^/obj/geo1\\" will match everything in /obj except for /obj/geo1.

    A bundle may also have a filter to specify what types of nodes may be in
    the bundle. See hou.nodeTypeFilter for the possible filters. If you try
    to add a node to a regular bundle but the node does not match the
    filter, Houdini will fail to add the node. For smart bundles, the filter
    is applied after doing any pattern matching. For example, if the pattern
    is \\"/obj/*\\" and the filter is hou.nodeTypeFilter.Obj, the bundle will
    contain only the objects in /obj, without any SOPs, etc. inside them.
    Because the pattern is applied recursively, however, any objects inside
    object subnets will also be in the bundle.

    To specify a bundle in a node parameter that expects a list of nodes,
    prefix the bundle name with @. For example, you can enter @bundle1 in
    the light mask parameter of an object so it is lit by the nodes inside
    the bundle named bundle1.

    You can view and edit node bundles in Houdini\'s Bundle List pane. Use
    hou.nodeBundle_ and hou.nodeBundles to access existing node bundles, and
    hou.addNodeBundle to create a new bundle.

    hou.NodeConnection

    Represents a connection (wire) between two Nodes.

    OVERVIEW

        You can get a list of NodeConnection objects from a hou.Node
        instance using hou.Node.inputConnections and
        hou.Node.outputConnections.


        NOTE
            It is probably easier to use the hou.Node.inputs and
            hou.Node.outputs methods (which return the endpoints of a node's
            connections) to traverse the network, rather than dealing with
            the connections themselves.

        This object is read-only. To create or edit connections, use methods
        on the node, such as hou.Node.setNamedInput, hou.Node.setInput,
        hou.Node.setFirstInput, hou.Node.setNextInput,
        hou.Node.createInputNode, and hou.Node.createOutputNode.

    INPUT AND OUTPUT MEANING

        The hou.NodeConnection.outputNode and hou.NodeConnection.inputNode
        are named in relation to the input and output ends of the connector.
        So, outputNode() returns the node at the output end of this
        connection, in relation to the flow of data through the network.
        inputNode() returns the node that provides data to the output node.

        For the other methods on this object, if the method name starts with
        input, it is referring to data on the inputNode(). If the method
        name starts with output, it is referring to data from the
        outputNode(). There is one exception to this though: inputIndex()
        refers the the input number on the outputNode(), and outputIndex()
        refers to the output number of the inputNode().

            Sets this parameter's expression.

            expression: A string containing the expression that will go inside
            the parameter.

            language: Either a hou.exprLanguage enumeration value or None.

            If language is None and the parameter does not already contain an
            expression, the language will be the node's expression language.
            (See hou.OpNode.expressionLanguage.) Otherwise, if language is None
            and the parameter already has an expression, the expression language
            will not change.

            replace_expression: This parameter only has effect if the parameter
            already contains keyframes. If it is True, Houdini will replace the
            keyframe before the current time with one containing the new
            expression. Otherwise, it will always add a keyframe at the current
            time. Note that this behavior matches what happens when you edit an
            expression from Houdini's parameter dialog.

            Unlike hou.Parm.set, this method does not follow channel references.
            That is, if this parameter is referencing another parameter and you
            call setExpression(), it change the channel reference expression
            into the specified expression.

            If the parameter does not already contain any keyframes, this method
            is roughly equivalent to setting a keyframe at frame 1, where the
            keyframe's expression and language are the ones specified.

            This method can be approximately implemented as follows:

          > def setExpression(self, expression, language=None, replace_expression=None)
          > if self.template().type() == hou.parmTemplateType.String:
          >     k = hou.StringKeyframe()

          > if len(self.keyframes()):
          >     if replace_expression:
          >     k.setTime(self.effectiveKeyframeAtFrame(hou.frame()).time())
          >     else:
          >     k.setTime(hou.time())

            brief
                When <brief> is True, the output script omits commands for
                setting values and flags that are set to the factory defaults.
                The script also omits keyframe commands that set unused values,
                slopes and accelerations. The value of <brief> must be either
                True or False. save_values: When <save_values> is True, asCode
                outputs commands for setting the parameter tuple\'s values. The
                value of <save_values> must be either True or False.

            save_keyframes
                When <save_keyframes> is True, asCode outputs commands for
                creating the parameter tuple\'s keyframes (if any). The value of
                <save_keyframes> must be either True or False.

            save_keys_in_frames
                When <save_keys_in_frames> is True, asCode outputs commands for
                setting channel and key times in samples (frames) instead of
                seconds. This parameter has no effect if <save_keyframes> is set
                to False. The value of <save_keys_in_frames> must be either True
                or False.

            save_flag_values
                When <save_flag_values> is True, asCode outputs commands for

            save_aliases
                When <save_aliases> is True, asCode outputs commands for setting
                the parameter tuple\'s channel aliases. The value of
                <save_aliases> must be either True or False.

            function_name
                If <function_name> is specified, then the output script is
                wrapped in a Python function definition with the given name.
                <function_name> must be a non-zero length string consisting of
                only alphanumeric and underscore characters. Any invalid
                characters are internally converted to underscores.

            The wrapper function takes in a single argument which must be a
            reference to an existing node parameter tuple. For symmetry, the
            function also returns the parameter tuple reference.

            Here is an example of saving the output to a file and then loading
            it back into Houdini:

          > # Get a reference to the target parameter tuple.
          > pt = hou.parmTuple(\\"/obj/geo1/t\\")

class ParmTuple:
    '''

    hou.ParmTuple

    A tuple of one or more node parameters. Each parameter tuple has a
    unique name within its node.

    The ParmTuple class behaves like a Python sequence, so you can index
    into it using square brackets, iterate over it, call len on it, etc. The
    elements inside the parameter tuple are hou.Parm objects.

    A parameter tuple\'s name may only contain letters, numbers, and
    underscores. For example, objects contain a parameter tuple named \\"t\\"
    that contains three integer parameters. The names of the parameters
    inside the tuple are determined from the parameter tuple\'s name and its
    naming scheme. For example, the \\"t\\" parameter uses the XYZW naming
    scheme, so the three parameters inside it are named \\"tx\\", \\"ty\\", and
    \\"tz\\". Note that if the parameter tuple only contains one parameter, the
    tuple and the parameter inside it may have the same name.

    In addition to a name, a parameter tuple also has a label that is
    displayed to the user in the parameter dialog. For example, the \\"t\\"
    parameter\'s label is \\"Translate\\". The label may contain spaces and
    punctuation characters.

    Each parameter in a tuple stores a value. Different instances of parm
    tuples in different nodes will store their own set of parameter values.
    The value in a parameter may be animated, in which case the parameter
    evaluates to a different result depending on the current time on the
    playbar. See hou.Keyframe for more information about animated
    parameters.

    Each hou.NodeType has a set of parameter tuple descriptions associated
    with it, and each instance of a hou.OpNode has a corresponding set of
    parameter tuple instances. The parameter tuples store specific values
    that are saved with the node. The descriptions of the parameter tuples,
    however, are represented by a hou.ParmTemplate. A parameter template
    describes the type, default values, ranges, etc. of a parameter tuple.

    See also hou.parmTuple_ and hou.OpNode.parmTuple.

    hou.Point

    Represents a point on a geometry primitive, such as a polygon or NURBS
    surface.

    Each Point object resides inside a Geometry object and stores a 3D
    position. Points may be shared between primitives (such as polygons),
    and the set of points and primitives describes a 3D shape.

    Each point can store arbitrary values in named attributes.

            returns a 3-tuple of floats, not a Vector3 object:

        setPosition(self, position)

            Changes the point\'s location. You would typically call this method
            from the code of a Python-defined SOP.

            position is any sequence of floats, such has a hou.Vector3 or a
            tuple or list of floats, of length 3 or 4. The fourth coordinate
            corresponds to the weight, and is usually 1. The weight is typically
            used by NURBS curves and sequences. If the sequence is of size 3,
            the weight will be unchanged.

            This method is a shortcut for calling hou.Point.setAttribValue on
            the P attribute.

            Raises hou.GeometryPermissionError if the geometry is not

            3 or 4.

            Houdini\'s geometry spreadsheet as the fourth component of the
            position. Point weights are used by NURBS.

            Usually, the weight is 1.0.

            This method is an alternative for accessing the Pw attribute of the
            point that will still work even when the Pw attribute does not
            exist.

    hou.PrimGroup

    A named group of primitives inside a Geometry object.

    Primitive groups reside inside the geometry, and each primitive group
    has a unique name.

    Groups are either ordered or unordered. When asking for the contents of
    an ordered group, the results will be returned in the order they were
    added to to the group. For an unordered group, the results will be
    returned in an arbitrary order (though it is normally arranged by
    increasing primitive number). When creating a group using the group SOP,
    use the <Create Ordered> checkbox to create an ordered group. When
    creating one from Python, Use the is_ordered parameter of
    hou.Geometry.createPrimGroup to control whether a group is ordered.

    A representation of a 3D rotation (or orientation). You can smoothly

    Quaternions provide an easy way to nicely interpolate between two

    A quaternion is represented by a vector of 4 floats (x, y, z, and w).
    Any rotation in three dimensions is a rotation by some angle about some
    axis, and you can think of the (x, y, z) portion of the quaternion as
    storing the axis and the w portion as storing a (representation of) the
    angle.

        __init__(self)

            You can construct a quaternion from a 3x3 rotation matrix, a 4x4
            rotation matrix, a rotation about an axis, Euler angles, or an (x,
            y, z, w) tuple. Note that rotations are represented as unit
            quaternions (i.e. quaternions of length 1), so constructing a
            quaternion from an arbitrary (x, y, z, w) tuple will not necessarily
            give a unit quaternion.

    hou.Ramp

    A Ramp represents a function that yields either floating point values or
    colors. You can evaluate this function between 0.0 and 1.0, and the
    function's shape is determined by a sequence of values at key positions
    between 0.0 and 1.0.

    If you evaluate a ramp parameter on a node, Houdini will return a Ramp
    object.

    You can check the curve basis of a ramp you get from a parameter by
    calling the hou.Ramp.basis method,which returns a hou.rampBasis value.

    In the Hermite basis, the curve passes through the odd control points,
    and the even control points control the tangent at the previous point.
    See the Wikipedia article on Hermite spline curves for more information.

    To get a smooth curve, you should evenly space the control points.

            basis
                A sequence of hou.rampBasis values, one for each key. The ramp
                basis for a key determines how Houdini interpolates from the key
                up until the next key. If there is no next key, Houdini will
                hold the value constant until the end of the [0,1] domain,
                regardless of the ramp basis.

            keys
                A sequence of floats, one for each key, each between 0.0 and
                1.0, inclusive. Each key represents the location in the [0,1]
                domain of its corresponding value.

            values
                A sequence of values, where each value corresponds to a key.
                When asked to evaluate at a value where there is no key, Houdini
                will interpolate between adjacent values using the basis
                function for the key on the left.

                This sequence is either a sequence of floats or a sequence of
                triples of floats. In the former case, the newly-created ramp
                will evaluate to a single floating-point value. In the latter
                case, it will evaluate to a color.

            Raises hou.InvalidSize if the keys and values sequences are not not
            same size, or if values contains subsequences of floats that are not
            3 elements long.

                Sequence of 2 or 3 values, overrides the frame range and frame

                factors will be applied to the node and all dependencies that

                Either hou.renderMethod.RopByRop or

                If True, ignores any lock flags on this node and its
                dependencies.

            verbose
                If True, then the method will print messages during the render.
                For example, a message is printed when each frame starts
                rendering.

            output_progress
                If True, then the method will print Alfred-style progress

            Registers a Python callback that Houdini call whenever a render

            run immediately before or after the correspoding script callback on
            the ROP node, such as the Pre Frame or Post Frame script, depending
            on the value of run_before_script.

            Callbacks only persist for the current session -- they\'re not saved
            to the .hip file. If you want persistent callbacks in every session,
            you can add them in code in 456.py (runs when the user opens a .hip
            file). See where to add Python scripting for more information.
            Alternatively, you can add your callback to the script hook
            parameters on the ROP node parameter interface.


            callback
                A callable Python object, such as a function or bound method.
                The callback is invoked with the hou.RopNode instance that it
                was added to, the hou.ropRenderEventType that indicates the type
                of event that occurred, and the time at which the event occured.

            run_before_script
                A boolean value that indicates whether or not the callback
                should be inovked before the correpsonding script callback on
                the ROP node. By default, callbacks are invoked after the script
                has completed.


            NOTE
                If you try to add the exact same callback function more than
                once, Houdini will still only call the function only once in
                response to a render event.

    hou.SceneViewer

    Pane tab type dedicated to displaying the current scene. This is usually
    the biggest pane in the center of the pane layout.

    OVERVIEW

        A viewer is a type of pane that shows the scene. The viewer's
        contents is conceptually divided into viewports. By default, the
        scene viewer shows a single viewport, the Perspective view. However,
        you can use the view layout controls to, for example, split the view
        into four viewports (Perspective, Top, Front, and Right views).
        Viewports are the parts of the interface that actually display the
        scene to the user.

        To get a reference to a scene viewer, see the following methods:


        hou.ui.paneTabOfType
            Use hou.ui.paneTabOfType(hou.paneTabType.SceneViewer) to get a
            Scene Viewer pane tab in the current pane layout. If the current
            layout has no Scene Viewer pane tab, this returns None.

            To be more precise about which viewer you grab in a possible
            multi-viewer layout, see also hou.ui.curDesktop to get a
            hou.Desktop object representing the current pane layout, and
            hou.Desktop.sceneViewers to get a list of scene viewer pane tabs
            in the current layout.

        showCurrentSopGeometry(self, value)

            Set the geometry display flag, on or off, on the current SOP node.
            When the flag is on, the viewport displays the geometry attached to
            the node, or hides when it's off. The flag is on by default when a
            SOP state enters.

            Consider this scenario, the display flag is set to true on a
            downstream node, but an upstream node is selected. When you enter
            the node's state, normally the viewport will show the upstream
            node's geometry in wireframe, but the display node in shaded. In
            some cases, the state wants to set parameters on the selected node
            whose result is best visualized in the downstream node. In this
            case, showCurrentSopGeometry can be used to turn off the display of
            the upstream node's geometry.


            NOTE
                For SOP Python states, Houdini remembers the current node's
                geometry display flag when the state enters and will set it back
                to its original value when the state exits.

class Selection:

    hou.Selection

    A class that represents a geometry component selection.

    Component selections are not tied to any specific hou.Geometry.
    Therefore most method on this class must be passed a Geometry object to
    look up information about individual components. This explicit
    separation allows the selection class to be used as a utility class for
    processing geometry topology (growing the set of components, shrinking
    it, finding the boundary, etc.). This separation also avoids any
    expectations that changing the contents of a selection object might be
    expected to update the selection visible on some geometry in the
    viewport. Setting the visible viewport selection must always be an
    explicit operation on a hou.SopNode in order for Houdini to be able to
    track changes properly.

    If a selection object is returned from a call to hou.Geometry.selection,
    hou.GeometrySelection.selections, or a hou.SopNode.selection, the
    selection cannot be modified. A copy of the selection must be made first
    with the freeze() method. This new selection can be modified, and passed
    back into a hou.SopNode.setSelection if desired. Because each SOP has a
    selection for each component type, when you set a new selection it will
    replace the existing selection of that component type. Note that this
    may not result in the visible selection in the viewport changing if the
    viewport is not currently configured to select that component type. The
    viewport selection type can be controlled with the hou.SceneViewer
    class. A selection created by calling any of the hou.Selection()
    initializer methods are created in a modifiable state, so a call to
    freeze() is not required.

    A selection returned from a hou.Geometry or a hou.SopNode is a reference
    to the source selection, and so will change if the selection on the
    source geometry is changed. This seems like a departure from the
    separation of selection objects from any particular geometry, however it
    matches the behavior of the hou.Geometry class returned from a SOP node.
    This is because the underlying selection data is shared with the SOP
    rather than copied. The freeze() method can be used to force a copy of
    the selection data that is disconnected from any particular SOP (as well
    as allowing the selection contents to be modified).

        groupTypeParmValues(self) -> tuple of int

            Return a tuple of indices mapping geometry types to indices on the
            geometry type parameter menu.

            Whether or not a selector is ordered is a property of the selector
            type, and you cannot specify it when creating a new selector.
            Instead, you must choose the appropriate selector type. For example,
            the everything selector can select primitives, primitive groups,
            points, point groups, edges, and breakpoints. It sets a group type
            menu parameter to match the type of selection, and this menu must
            have the entries Guess from Group, Breakpoints, Edges, Points, and
            Primitives. For an everything selector, this method returns (4, 4,
            3, 3, 2, 1), mapping the geometry element types to 0-based entries
            in the menu. For example, if the user selects edges, the selector
            will look up the fifth element (2) and set the menu parameter to the
            item at index 2 (Edges).

            The length of the tuple of ints is the same as
            len(self.geometryTypes). If this selector is not intended to work
            with a menu parameter, each value in the tuple will be -1.

        ordered(self) -> bool

            Return whether or not this selector preserves the order in which the
            user selected the geometry.

            For example, the selector is for points and the user clicks on
            points 1, 0, and 2, in that order, an ordered selector will set the
            SOP\'s group parameter to \\"1 0 2\\", while an unordered selector will
            set it to \\"0-2\\". For SOPs where the order of the group selector
            matters, use ordered selectors.

            Whether or not a selector is ordered is a property of the selector
            type, and you cannot specify it when creating a new selector.
            Instead, you must choose the appropriate selector type. For example,
            prims is an unordered selector type, but ordered_prims is ordered.

            Dragging the geometry forces the selector to finish immediately, the
            selector connects the input and sets the group parameter, and

            render type. This string is written to the file that is read in by
            the renderer.


            render_type
                A string representing the renderer. If this string is empty or

                Possible render types include \\"VMantra\\" (Mantra), \\"RIB\\"

                You can use hou.ShopNodeType.renderMask to determine the render

                that they will work with any shader type.

            If you pass in an unknown or unsupported render type, this method
            returns an empty string.

            Return this node\'s current point. You would typically call this
            method from an expression on a node that iterates over a set of

            This method lets you implement the Python equivalent of Hscript\'s
            local variables. Many of Houdini\'s SOPs iterate over a set of
            points, and for each point they store the current point and then
            evaluate a parameter. If the parameter contains a local variable,
            Houdini looks up the SOP\'s current point when evaluating that
            variable. For example, the point SOP evaluates the t parameter for
            each point, and sets that point\'s position according to the value of
            the parameter. If that parameter contains, say, the local variable
            $TX, it will evaluate to the x position of the current point.

            This method gives you access to the hou.Point representation of
            Houdini\'s current point. Using this point you could evaluate the
            position, an attribute value, or do more complex operations like
            compute the distance from the point to the origin.

            Raises hou.OperationFailed if you call this method from outside a

            Add a selector to this SOP node type. When the user creates a new
            instance of this SOP in the viewer, Houdini will invoke all the
            selectors, wait for the user to select geometry, and then connect
            input SOPs and fill in group parameters to match what was selected.


            name
                A name to give this selector. The name must be unique within
                this node type.

            selector_type
                The name of the type of selector to use. Different selectors
                have different behaviors. For example prims will select only
                primitives and is used, for example, by the cookie SOP. points
                will select only points, and is used by SOPs like the point SOP.
                everything will select any geometry, and is used for SOPs like
                xform and blast.

            prompt
                A string to display at the bottom of the viewer to instruct the
                user what to select.

            primitive_types
                A sequence of hou.primType enumeration values to specify what
                primitive types are allowed. This parameter has no effect if the
                selector does not select primitives. If this sequence is empty,
                all primitive types will be allowed.

            group_parm_name
                The name of the SOP node parameter containing the group field.
                The selector will set this parameter to the string representing
                the points, primitives, edges, etc. chosen by the user in the
                viewer. If None, the selector will look for a parameter named
                group.

            group_type_parm_name
                The name of the SOP node parameter containing the menu of
                geometry types. If the selector can select multiple geometry
                types (e.g. points or primitives), it will set this parameter to
                match the type of geometry the user chose. The transform SOP,
                for example, has a Group Type parameter that tells it how to
                interpret the string in the Group parameter. If None, the
                selector will look for a parameter named grouptype.

            input_index
                The index of the input connector on the SOP node where the
                selector should wire input SOPs. A cookie SOP, for example, has
                two input connectors. It has two selectors, one for each input
                connector.

            input_required
                Whether or not this input is required or optional. If the user
                does not select any geometry and the input is not required, the
                selector will not wire anything to its input connector.

            allow_dragging
                Whether the user is allowed to select the geometry and begin
                manipulating the handles with a single mouse drag. A transform
                SOP, for example, lets you select the geometry and drag it right
                away to transform it. Dragging the geometry forces the selector
                to finish immediately, the selector connects the input and sets
                the group parameter, and subsequent mouse movements are passed
                to the handle which translates the geometry by changing
                parameter values.

            empty_string_selects_all
                Whether or not to use an empty string in the group parameter if
                the user selects all the geometry. If False, Houdini will place
                an asterisk (*) in the group parameter when the user selects all
                the geometry. Most SOPs use an empty string.

            You would typically call this method from the shelf tool script of a
            digital asset. For example, you might put the following in the Tools
            script section of a Python sop that transforms points (having a
            parameter named group):

          > hou.sopNodeTypeCategory().nodeTypes()[\'$HDA_NAME\'].addSelector(
          >     \\"Points to Transform\\",
          >     \\"points\\",
          >     prompt=\\"Select the points to transform and press Enter to complete\\",
          >     group_parm_name=\\"group\\")

            See also hou.Geometry.globPoints and hou.Geometry.globPrims for
            information on how to parse the strings the selector puts in the
            group field.

            This function does not treat path separator characters specially.

            Returns 1 if any patterns in the pattern string matches the input
            string, or 0 if no patterns match.

            In order to match, a pattern must match the input string from

            pattern is a space-separated list of one or more patterns. This can

            patterns, foo and bar, and neither of those patterns match foo bar
            (since the pattern must match from beginning to end).

            Similarly,

          > >>> hou.patternMatch(\\"foo bar\\", \\"foo\\")
          > True

            ...will return 1, because the string matches the first of the two
            arguments in the pattern (foo and bar).

          > >>> hou.patternMatch(\\"/foo/*\\", \\"/foo/bar/blah\\", path_match = True)
          > False

            ...will return 0, because the wildcard only matches against the
            first path component (/bar), leaving the last path component (/blah)
            unmatched.

          > >>> hou.patternMatch(\\"/foo/**\\", \\"/foo/bar/blah\\", path_match = True)
          > True

            ...will return 1, because the multi-level wildcard will matches

    hou.TextDrawable

    A drawable object to render text in the viewport.

    OVERVIEW

        A text drawable is designed for custom Python states and is used for
        drawing text elements in the viewport in viewport coordinates. For
        instance, you can use a text drawable to display directives for
        guiding the user or for displaying technical information.

        hou.TextDrawable lets you translate, rotate and scale the text in 2D
        space with viewport coordinates. The lower left corner of the
        viewport is the base point coordinate (0,0).

        Here\'s an example for displaying text in the upper left corner of
        the viewport.

      > import hou
      > 
      > class State(object):       
      >     def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):

            These strings correspond to the Keywords field in the tool editing
            window. Internally, the keywords are stored as a list of strings.
            But if a user edits the Keyword field in the UI, Houdini splits the

        viewerStateInfoFromFile(state_filepath) -> (str, str)

            Returns the viewer state information for a given python state file.
            The information is returned as a tuple containing the python state
            type name and a JSON dictionary string describing the registered
            viewer state information.


            state_filepath
                A python state file path. The method returns an empty tuple if
                the file path is not a python state file or the python state
                contained in the file is not registered.


            NOTE
                This method doesn\'t work with HDA python state files.

        viewerHandleInfo(handle_names) -> string

            Return a JSON dictionary string describing all registered viewer
            handles in Houdini. The viewer handles can be queried by type name.


            handle_names
                Array of handle type names. The function returns a dictionary
                containing all registered handles specified in the array. If the
                array is empty (default), all registered viewer handles are
                returned.

        openValueLadder(initial_value, value_changed_callback,

        data_type=hou.valueLadderDataType.Float)

            Displays a value ladder control, the UI that typically appears when
            you press [MMB] on a field in Houdini. This lets you display ladder
            controls on your own custom UI, such as Qt edit fields.

            The typical workflow is:

             1. You should listen for [MMB] press and release events on your
                field.

             2. When the user presses [MMB] on the field, call this function to
                show the ladder. The function returns immediately but the ladder
                stays visible.

             3. As the user moves the mouse with [MMB] pressed down, you must
                call hou.ui.updateValueLadder with the mouse pointer
                coordinates.

             4. The ladder calls the value_changed_callback function you
                supplied as the user changes the value.

             5. When the user releases [MMB], call hou.ui.closeValueLadder.

            Only one value ladder window can be open at a time. This function
            raises hou.OperationFailed if another ladder window is currently
            open.


            initial_value
                The initial numeric value the ladder is set to when it opens.

            value_changed_callback
                A function that takes a single argument. As the user edits the
                number with the ladder, the ladder calls this function with each
                new value.

            type
                One of the values in hou.valueLadderType. The available types
                are Generic and Angle. This affects the increments on the
                ladder.

            data_type
                One of the values in hou.valueLadderDataType. Integer and Float
                ladders have different increments.

            This examples demonstrates how to add value ladder window support to
            an input field class that derives from Qt's QLineEdit class:

            Open a window for editing and saving a text file.

            The editor buttons:

          * Apply: Save the file only if the source has changed.

            NOTE
                When applying unsaved changes, the editor prompts the user if
                the file being edited is not in sync with the file on disk. At

                file on disk) or cancel the operation.

            An optional callback and a dictionary of user-defined parameters can
            be specified to customize the Apply and Accept operations.


            title
                Name of the window title.

            file_path
                A string set with a full path to the file to edit. Exception is
                raised if the string is empty.

                The file extension determines the language settings used by the
                editor. The following file types are supported:

                .py

                Python

                .cmd

                hscript

                .txt/no extension

                Text document

            action_callback
                An optional callback triggered by the editor when either the
                Apply or Accept button is clicked. The callback can be used to
                perform a custom operation. The editor saves the file being
                edited, if required, before calling the callback.

                The callback name is user-defined and takes a dictionary
                argument as input:

              > def myApplyAction( **kwargs )

            params
                A dictionary mapping user-defined entries to values of type int,

          * Mice with clicky wheels will generally output a -1 or +1 event for

          * Mice with free spinning wheels, or touch sensitive surfaces (such as
            the Apple Magic Mouse), will produce a wider range of values.
            Small/slow scrolling might trigger a mouse wheel event but this
            method returns 0, whereas big/fast scrolling can produce higher
            numbers for each event, up to around 7, with the numbers increasing
            as the user throws the wheel and decreasing as it slows.

    other than 0 or 1, like adding two points together, are not valid.
    Similarly, is makes sense to speak about a vector's length but not a
    position's length. The fourth component also affects how the
    position/vector is transformed; see hou.Vector3.__mul__ for more
    information.

    Existing inside a Geometry object, a Vertex object is contained in

    This setup allows points to be shared between primitives. For example, a

    primitives, but vertices in different polygons may refer to the same
    point. When that point moves, the corresponding vertices on all adjacent
    polygons will also move, preventing polygon edges from separating.

    Note that you can use hou.Vertex.point to retrieve a point from a
    vertex, but there is no method to retrieve all the vertices referring to

    hou.ViewerDragger

    A mechanism to support interactive dragging operations.

    The hou.ViewerDragger class provides various methods to help
    implementing mouse dragging functionality without worrying about many
    details like constraining the mouse movement or making sure drag
    coordinates are computed relative to a specific origin.

    hou.ViewerDragger is an abstract base class for hou.ViewerHandleDragger
    and hou.ViewerStateDragger, these are the classes you must use to
    instantiate a dragger.

    A dragger operation can be divided in three parts:

     1. start: This step configures the dragger for a specific drag
        operation.

     2. drag: This actually executes the drag operation interactively as
        configured in step #1.

     3. end: Ends the operation and cleanup the dragger.

    Drag operations like translating a geometry along a plane, along a line
    or rotating a geometry around an axis can all be accomplished with a
    dragger.

            Defines a viewer handle visual parameter. A viewer handle
            implementation can expose these parameters to Houdini so users can
            change them visually through its gadgets. You can also change these

            debugging purposes.

            A viewer handle should implement the onParmChangeEvent handler to
            react to parameter changes. See viewer handle event handlers for
            details.


            name

            default_value
                The default value of the parameter. This is the value Houdini
                uses to initialize the parameter. The value type should ideally
                match param_type but Houdini will do its best to convert the
                type appropriately. Defaults to None.

            label
                The parameter label. If sets to None (default), the label is set
                with the parameter name.

            min_limit
                Describes the minimum value the parameter can be set with.

              * hou.parmTemplateType.Float

            param_type

            visible
                Controls whether the parameter is visible or not in the Handle
                Parameter Dialog. Defaults to True.


                NOTE

                previous one. Defaults to False.

            default_value
                The default value of the parameter. This is the value Houdini
                uses to initialize the parameter. The value type should ideally
                match param_type but Houdini will do its best to convert the
                type appropriately. Defaults to None.

                Parameter type

                Value type

                hou.parmTemplateType.Button

class ViewerStateMenu:

    hou.ViewerStateMenu

    Builds a context menu for a viewer state.

    OVERVIEW

        The ViewerStateMenu class lets you build a context menu for a viewer
        state. This class is also represents sub-menus of the top-level
        context menu.

        Currently you can add the following items to the menu

      * Toggle (checkbox) item: represents a setting you can turn on or off

      * Radio strip: represents a choice of several mutually exclusive
        items.

      * Action item: represents an action to preform. You implement the
        action in the state\'s onMenuAction method.

      * Separator item: creates a visual separation between groups of items
        in the menu.

        Hotkeys, registered using a hou.PluginHotkeyDefinitions object, can
        be added to toggle, action and radio strip menu items.

        See setting up viewer state context menus for more information.

        The following example shows how to implement and bind a menu to a
        sop viewer state.

    hou.ViewerStateTemplate

    Contains attributes describing a custom viewer state (tool).

    Viewer states control interaction in the viewport. For example, the
    Rotate tool is a view state. The Handles tool allows access to the state
    associated with the current node. Houdini lets you create and register
    your own custom view states in Python.

    This object describes a custom state, including its implementation class
    and bindings (e.g. menus, handles, hotkeys, selectors, etc...). You
    supply an instance of this object when registering a custom state, and
    Houdini uses it to create concrete instances of the state.

    > import hou
    > 
    > # Create a class implementing the state callbacks
    > class MyState(object):
    >     def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
    >         self.state_name = state_name
    >         self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer
    > 
    > 
    > # Create a template to describe the state and its bindings

    > )

    > # Register the template with Houdini

    For information on how to create your own custom view states, see Python
    states.

        __init__(self, state_name, state_label, node_type_category,
        contexts=None)

            Creates a new instance of ViewerStateTemplate representing a unique
            custom state type.

            ViewerStateTemplate is identified by a name and a category type. The
            name is the custom type of the state. The category specifies the
            context-level that Houdini uses to run the state. If you want your
            state to run across multiple context-levels, additional contexts can
            be added with the contexts parameter. Therefore, when the state is
            active and the user switches to a new context, Houdini will reuse
            the current state instance, provided the new context matches one of
            the state contexts.

            This example demonstrates how to register an OBJ state which can run
            in the SOP and CHOP contexts as well:

            state_name
                A unique string to identify the viewer state.

            state_label
                A human-readable name for the state, for display in the user
                interface.

            node_type_category
                An instance of hou.NodeTypeCategory. For SOPs use the result of:

              > hou.sopNodeTypeCategory()

                For OBJ states use:

              > hou.objNodeTypeCategory()

                For LOP states use:

              > hou.lopNodeTypeCategory()

                For DOP states use:

              > hou.dopNodeTypeCategory()

            contexts
                A list of hou.NodeTypeCategory objects to specify additional
                context-levels for the state.

                Choose any of the following types to add to contexts:

              * hou.chopNodeTypeCategory

            Creates a parameter template for a viewer state. The template
            describes a parameter with settings such as the name or the data it
            holds. See state parameters for more details on how to use them.


            align
                Specifies how the parameter is aligned in the Parameter Dialog.
                If True, the parameter is aligned horizontally with the next
                bound parameter. if False, the parameter is displayed below the
                previous one. Defaults to False.

            default_value
                The default value of the parameter. This is the value Houdini
                uses to initialize the parameter. The value type should ideally
                match param_type but Houdini will do its best to convert the
                type appropriately. Defaults to None.

            name
                The parameter string identifier. The name cannot be empty and
                must be unique within the state or an exception is raised.

            label
                The parameter label. If sets to None (default), the label is set
                with the parameter name.

            menu_as_button_strip
                If True, the hou.parmTemplateType.Menu parameter is set to use a
                button strip widget to display the menu items. Buttons are
                displayed with the menu item icons, if any, or with the menu
                item labels otherwise. menu_as_button_strip defaults to False
                and is ignored for other types.

            menu_items
                A list of string tuples for defining the items of a
                hou.parmTemplateType.Menu parameter. menu_items is ignored for
                other parameter types.

                The tuple can contain 2 or 3 elements:

              * Item 0: the menu item identifier.

              * Item 1: the menu item label.

              * hou.parmTemplateType.Float

            num_components
                Specifies the number of components to create for the parameter
                template. Defaults to 1. Exceptions are raised if the value is
                invalid.

                num_components > 1 is supported for the following types:

              * hou.parmTemplateType.Int

        bindGadget(self, drawable_type, gadget_name, gadget_label=None)

            Lets you bind a gadget drawable to a viewer state. A gadget is a
            special geometry drawable which provides visual interaction support
            for picking and locating the underlying gadget\'s geometry.

            Houdini uses the binding info to create the gadget drawable
            instances, you don\'t create objects of this type by yourself. The
            gadget instances are stored in a dictionary, accessible with the
            state_gadgets class attribute. Use the gadget name to query
            self.state_gadgets for a specific gadget.


            NOTE
                self.state_gadgets cannot not be accessed from the class
                __init__ method, but you can use it however from any other class
                methods.

            Houdini provides the picking and locating support, you don\'t have to
            implement anything specific to locate or pick a gadget component.
            hou.ViewerStateContext is used by Houdini to store the active gadget
            picking and locating information, this context is created by Houdini

            Binds a geometry selector to a SOP viewer state. This selector is
            used for selecting geometry elements when the underlying viewer
            state is active. This selector can only be used in a scene viewer,
            exception is thrown otherwise at registration
            (hou.ui.registerViewerStateTemplate).

            Multiple geometry selectors can be bound to a viewer state. However,
            other selector types cannot be mixed, exception is thrown otherwise.

            The viewer state plug-in can implement the onSelection method to
            receive new selections. onSelection gets the new selection as a
            hou.GeometrySelection stored in the selection entry of the input
            kwargs dictionary. The return value can be True to stop the
            selection tool or False to keep it running. Pressing [Enter] also
            terminates the selector.


            allow_drag
                Determines whether selecting a component with a single mouse
                click completes the selection. This is typically used to prevent
                a multiple component selection. Defaults to False.

            allow_other_sops
                Allow selecting components on geometry from other geometry nodes
                visible in the viewport. Defaults to False.

            auto_start
                If True (the default), starts the selector when the viewer state
                is activated. If False, you must specify a hotkey argument that
                activates the selector.

            toolbox
                If True (the default), the selector toolbox is displayed when
                the selector is activated. If False, the selector toolbox will
                be hidden.

            consume_selection
                If True (default), clears the current selection when the
                selector is deactivated.

            geometry_types
                An array of hou.geometryType values representing the component
                types the user can select. The default is an empty list, the
                selector follows the Geometry Select Mode.

            hotkey
                An optional hotkey which acts as a switch for starting or
                stopping the selector. The default is an empty string.

            initial_selection
                When use_existing_selection is False, this is a string of
                component group syntax representing what to set the selection to
                when the state is activated. The default is no selection.

            initial_selection_type
                A hou.geometryType value, representing the type of components
                specified by the initial_selection argument. The default is
                None, the selector follows the Geometry Select Mode.

            name
                Optional name identifier (None by default) for the selector,
                must be unique within the viewer state. The name is used for
                triggering selector operations.

            ordered
                If this is True, Houdini returns the components in the selection
                in the order the user selected them. The default is False,
                meaning the order of the components you get is unrelated to the
                order they were selected.

                Only set this to True if for some reason you need to
                distinguish, for example, the first primitive the user clicked,
                or the last, or that kind of thing.

            prompt
                Prompt displayed in the viewport when the selector is active.
                The prompt is mandatory.

                A list of hou.primType values representing the primitive types
                the user can select. An empty list (default) allows selecting
                all types.

            quick_select
                If this is True, the state\'s selection event is called whenever
                the selection changes. If this is False, Houdini waits for the
                user to finish selection by pressing [Enter] before it notifies
                the state about the new selection.

            secure_selection
                This option is used to configure the selector for secure
                selection. By default, the selector always obey the current
                viewer\'s secure selection setting. For more details see Secure
                selection support and hou.secureSelectionOption.

            use_existing_selection
                If this is True, and a component selection exists when the user
                activates the state, Houdini will call onSelection with that
                selection. If this is False, Houdini will clear any existing
                selection and ask for a new selection.

            Binds a dynamics polygon selector to a DOP viewer state. This
            selector is used for selecting polygon elements when the underlying
            viewer state is active. This selector can only be used in a scene
            viewer, exception is thrown otherwise at registration
            (hou.ui.registerViewerStateTemplate).

            Multiple dynamics, point and polygon selectors can be bound to a
            viewer state. However, other selector types cannot be mixed with DOP
            selectors, exception is thrown otherwise.

            The viewer state plug-in can implement the onSelection method to
            receive new selections. onSelection gets the new selection as a list
            of (hou.DopData,hou.GeometrySelection) tuples stored in the
            selection entry of the input kwargs dictionary. The return value can
            be True to stop the selection tool or False to keep it running.
            Pressing [Enter] also terminates the selector.

            hotkey
                An optional hotkey which acts as a switch for starting or
                stopping the selector. The default is None.

            name
                Optional name identifier (None by default) for the selector,
                must be unique within the viewer state. The name is used for
                triggering selector operations.

            Binds a drawable selector to a viewer state to select drawable
            components such as points, faces and lines. Drawable selectors are
            supported for the SOP, OBJ and LOP contexts. The selector selects
            components of drawables created by the viewer state, a mask can be
            used to make specific drawables selectable. Drawables created by the
            viewer state not in the mask are ignored by the selector.

            A selection event is triggered whenever the selection changes, the
            onSelection handler can be implemented by the viewer state plug-in
            to receive new selections. The locate information is sent to the
            viewer state whenever the mouse is positioned over drawable
            components, the onLocateSelection handler can be implemented by the
            viewer state plug-in to receive new drawable locate information. The
            viewer state typically uses these handlers for drawing the located
            and selected drawable components. See Binding a drawable selector
            for more details.


            auto_start
                If True (the default), starts the selector when the viewer state

            hotkey
                An optional hotkey which acts as a switch for starting or
                stopping the selector. The default is an empty string.

            name
                Optional name identifier (None by default) for the selector,

            Binds a selector to the digital asset tied to this viewer state. You
            can bind multiple selectors to the same viewer state.

            These selectors are typically used by the shelf tool of the digital
            asset to create new instances of the SOP nodes. Houdini will invoke
            all bounded selectors, wait for the user to select geometries, and
            then connect the input SOPs and fill in group parameters to match
            what was selected.

            This kind of selector is different from the ones created with
            hou.ViewerStateTemplate.bindGeometrySelector or
            hou.ViewerStateTemplate.bindObjectSelector. They are strictly used
            by Houdini and cannot be triggered with
            hou.SceneViewer.triggerStateSelector.


            name
                A unique selector name identifier.

            selector_type
                The type of the selector to bind. The following types are
                supported:

                prims

                Select only primitives.

                points

                Select only points.

                edges

                Select only edges.

                everything

                Select any geometries.

            prompt
                Prompt displayed in the viewport to instruct the user what to
                select. The prompt is mandatory.

            primitive_types
                Specify the type of selectable primitives (hou.primType).
                Defaults to all types.

            group_parm_name
                The name of the SOP node parameter containing the group field.
                The selector will set this parameter to the string representing
                the points, primitives, edges, etc. chosen by the user in the
                viewer. If None, the selector will look for a parameter named
                group.

            input_index
                The index of the input connector on the SOP node where the
                selector should wire input SOPs. A cookie SOP, for example, has
                two input connectors. It has two selectors, one for each input
                connector. Defaults to 0.

            input_required
                Specify if an input is required or not. If the user does not
                select any geometry and the input is not required, the selector
                will not wire anything to its input connector. Defaults to True.

            allow_dragging
                Determines if click-and-drag operations are allowed. Click-and-
                drag operations select the geometry and begin manipulating the
                handles with a single mouse drag. Dragging the geometry forces
                the selector to finish immediately, the selector connects the
                input and sets the group parameter, and subsequent mouse
                movements are passed to the handle which translates the geometry
                by changing parameter values. Defaults to True.

            Register a Python callback that Houdini will call whenever a
            particular action, or event, occurs related to a particular
            visualizer category.


            event_types
                A sequence of hou.viewportVisualizerEventType enumeration values
                describing the event types that will cause Houdini to call the
                callback function.

            callback
                A callable Python object, such as a function or bound method.
                Houdini will call this function whenever one of the event types
                in event_types occurs.

                Houdini calls the function with an event_type keyword argument
                containing the hou.nodeEventType value corresponding to the
                event that triggered the callback.

                Houdini will pass additional keyword arguments depending on the
                event type. For example, in a callback for the
                VisualizerParmsChanged event, Houdini will pass a visualizer
                keyword argument containing a hou.ViewportVisualizer reference
                to the visualizer that changed. See
                hou.viewportVisualizerEventType for the extra arguments (if any)
                passed for each event type.

                You can add **kwargs to the argument list to accept all keyword
                arguments, to allow the same callback to be used for different
                events, or to be safe from future changes:

              > def event_callback(event_type, **kwargs):
              >     ...

            NOTE
                If you try to add the exact same callback function more than
                once, Houdini will still only call the function only once in
                response to an event. However, it may be useful to add the same
                function if you want to register it with different event_types.

            Raises hou.OperationFailed if the event_types list argument is
            empty.

            The following example shows to set up a function that\'s called
            whenever any parameter on a visualizer in the Common category
            changes:

            operations on the voxel data and then store the result back into the
            volume from a Python SOP using hou.Volume.setAllVoxels. Note that
            Numpy allows you to reshape the flat tuple of floats to behave like
            a 3D matrix of floats.

            This method can be approximately implemented as follows (though this
            Python implementation is much slower):

          > def allVoxels(self):
          >     result = []
          >     xres, yres, zres = self.resolution()

    wants to save. If the user presses Cancel, the exit will be canceled and
    the next statement will execute.

    USAGE
      exit(exit_code=0, suppress_save_prompt=False)

    The exit confirmation prompt only appears if the session has unsaved
    changes. This function will not return until after the user has made a
    choice from the prompt. If this function is called from outside Houdini
    (e.g. MPlay or a non-graphical Python shell), the dialog is not
    displayed and suppress_save_prompt==True is implied.

    Note that if the user chose to exit, this function will raise a Python
    SystemExit exception to ensure the executing Python script terminates.
    This approach ensures that the next Python statement will not be
    executed, since Houdini may add events to its event queue that carry out
    the actual shutdown, or hou.exit() may be called from a different thread
    than the one executing the shutdown.

    Note that if you call sys.exit() from within the interactive Houdini
    Python shell, it will call hou.exit() with suppress_save_prompt=True.
    The Houdini Python shell does this by intercepting the SystemExit
    exception raised by sys.exit() and calling hou.exit(). Since both
    sys.exit() and hou.exit() both raise SystemExit exceptions, the shell
    calls hou._isExiting() to differentiate between the two.

    Avoid calling sys.exit() from any place other than the interactive
    Houdini Python shell, such as non-graphical Python shells, and instead
    call hou.exit(). Using hou.exit() ensures that Houdini shuts down
    cleanly.

def expressionGlobals() -> Any:
    '''

    hou.expressionGlobals

    Return the globals dictionary used by the parameter expression
    evaluation namespace.

    USAGE
      expressionGlobals() -> dict

    When Houdini evaluates a Python expression inside a parameter, it uses a
    separate namespace. This way, Houdini can run from hou import * and from
    hou.session import * in that namespace, allowing you to drop the hou.
    and hou.session. prefixes in your expressions, and the global namespace
    does not get polluted.

    In Python, namespaces are stored as dictionaries. This function returns
    the dictionary for the Python parameter expression namespace. It is
    analogous to the builtin globals function, which returns you the
    dictionary for the current namespace.

    You might use this function from the pythonrc.py file to set up Python
    functions that can be called from any Python parameter expression. For
    example, if you put your functions in a module called expr, you might
    put the following in pythonrc.py:

    > import expr
    > hou.expressionGlobals()[\'expr\'] = expr

    Then, from a Python expression, you could write expr.foo(), where foo is
    a function defined in your expr module.

    You can also use this dictionary with Python\'s exec statement. The
    following example also imports the expr module into the both the global
    and expression namespaces:

    > code = compile(\\"import expr\\", \\"<generated_code>\\", \\"exec\\")
    > exec code
    > exec code in hou.expressionGlobals()

    See Python Parameter Expressions for more information on using Python
    expressions in parameters. See startup scripts for more information
    about pythonrc.py.


    '''
def lvar(name: str) -> Any:
    '''

    hou.lvar

    Return the value of a node\'s local variable. Call this function from
    expressions inside node parameters.

    USAGE
      lvar(name) -> float or string

    Many node algorithms involve iterating over a series of points (or
    primitives or vertices, but we\'ll use points for the examples). These
    nodes evaluate their parameters for each point, setting a variable that
    you can access from an expression in that parameter to a value specific
    to that point. For example, the TX variable is set to evaluate to the X
    value of the position of the current point. These variables are called
    local variables because they are local to the expressions inside
    parameters in the node.

    In the Hscript expression language, you use $ to evaluate local
    variables, just like how you evaluate global variables. In Python, you
    use the lvar function. So, the Python equivalent of $TX is lvar(\\"TX\\").


    TIP
        Inside a parameter expression you can drop the hou. prefix from the
        call to lvar, since Houdini implicitly runs from hou import * when
        it evaluates expressions.

    If you call this function from outside a parameter expression it will
    raise hou.NotAvailable. If you call it with an invalid variable name, it
    will raise hou.OperationFailed. Note that you cannot use this function
    to evaluate Houdini global variables; instead use hou.expandString.

    Note that hou.SopNode.curPoint and similar methods on the hou.SopNode
    class return the current point that the node is iterating over. Using
    the point, you can evaluate attributes, etc, to perform the equivalent
    of a local variable. You can also access information that may not be
    accessible through local variables.

    Because Hscript vectors can be be of different lengths, the value is
    returned as a tuple of floats. If you know the vector is a particular
    length, you can construct a Vector2/Vector3/Vector4 out of the return
    value.

    Most of the time, you want to use hou.hscriptExpression over this
    function.

    > vector = hou.Vector3(hou.hscriptVectorExpression(\'vtorigin(\\"/obj/geo1\\", \\"/obj/geo2\\")\'))
    > print vector.length()

    Raises hou.OperationFailed if the expression is invalid or generates an
    error occur during evaluation.

    USAGE
      allowEnvironmentToOverwriteVariable(name, onoff)

    Note that you need to allow the variable to be overwritten from within
    Houdini/hython before loading in the hip file.

    For example, suppose you set the JOB environment variable to
    /home/john/dyproject and created a hip file in

def runVex(vex_file: str, inputs: dict[str, Any], precision=...) -> dict[str, Any]:
    '''

    hou.runVex

    Invokes the main function in a compiled VEX file, returning the exported
    values.

    USAGE
      runVex(vex_file, inputs, precision=\\"32\\") -> dict of str to values

    ARGUMENTS


        vex_file
            A string containing the path to a compiled VEX object file
            (.vex) on disk. This function does not accept VEX source code
            (.vfl), you must compile the source code first.

            Currently this function only works with functions in the cvex
            context.

            runVex currently raises an exception if the file path does not
            end with .vex.


            NOTE
                runVex always calls the main function in the compiled file
                (the function whose return type is the context type, cvex).
                It is not currently possible to call another function in the
                compiled file by name.

        inputs
            A dictionary mapping VEX input names to values.

          * If a value is a single number, string, hou.Vector3, hou.Vector4,
            hou.Matrix3, or hou.Matrix4, it is treated as a static value.

          * If a value is a sequence of values, it is treated as varying
            data the function will iterate over (possibly in parallel)
            automatically. This is the same as when, for example, a VEX
            snippet runs over all the points in a geometry. It is more
            efficient to call the function once with varying data than to
            call it separately for each of a list of different values.

          * If you supply multiple varying inputs, they must all be the same
            length and all values must be the same type. Houdini iterates
            over the corresponding values at each index of the varying
            sequences.

                For example, you might have two arguments corresponding to a
                point\'s color (Cd) and position (P) attributes:

              > runVex(\\"test.vex\\", {
              >     \\"Cd\\": [hou.Vector3(1.0, 0, 0), hou.Vector3(0, 1.0, 0), hou.Vector3(0, 0, 1.0)],
              >     \\"P\\": [hou.Vector3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0), hou.Vector3(2.0, 2.0, 2.0), hou.Vector3(3.0, 3.0, 3.0)]
              > })

                Houdini would zip the two lists together and iterate using
                the following values:

                1
                Vector3(1.0, 0, 0)

                Vector3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

                2
                Vector3(0, 1.0, 0)

                Vector3(2.0, 2.0, 2.0)

                3
                Vector3(0, 0, 1.0)

                Vector3(3.0, 3.0, 3.0)


            NOTE
                Because this function interprets a sequence as varying data,
                it is not currently possible for this function to call VEX
                with array arguments.

        precision
            Either \\"32\\" or \\"64\\". If you specify \\"64\\" Houdini will run the
            VEX snippet in 64-bit mode.

    RETURNS

        runVex() returns a dictionary mapping VEX output names to values.

        The main VEX function does not directly return values, it can only
        write to arguments marked export. This dictionary contains the
        output value of the exported arguments.

        If the input to the argument was static, the output will be a single
        value. If the input to the argument was varying, the output will be
        a tuple of values. If multiple arguments were varying, the output
        tuples will all be the same length.

    EXAMPLE

        For example, if you have the following code.vfl file and compile it
        to code.vex using vcc:

      > cvex add(float x=0; float y=0; export float out=0)
      > {
      >     out = x + y;
      > }

        You can then invoke it from Python using the following:

      > >>> hou.runVex(\\"code.vex\\", {\\"x\\":(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), \\"y\\":(7.1, 8.1, 9.1)})
      > {\\"out\\": (8.1, 10.1, 12.1)}
      > >>> hou.runVex(\\"code.vex\\", {\\"x\\":(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), \\"y\\":0.5})
      > {\\"out\\": (1.5, 2.5, 3.5)}
      > >>> hou.runVex(\\"code.vex\\", {\\"x\\":1.0, \\"y\\":0.5})
      > {\\"out\\": 1.5}
      > >>> hou.runVex(\\"code.vex\\", {\\"x\\":1.0, \\"y\\":0.5}, precision=\\"64\\")
      > {\\"out\\": 1.5}

    USING A VOP NETWORK

        The following code shows how you can write the VEX code created by a
        VOP network node (such as a CVEX VOP) to a file, for use with
        runVex:

      > import os
      > import tempfile
      > 
      > def runVexFromNode(vop_node, input_dict):
      >     handle, path = tempfile.mkstemp(prefix=vop_node.name(), suffix=\\".vex\\")
      >     vop_node.saveCompiledCookCodeToFile(path)
      >     os.close(handle)
      >     output_dict = hou.runVex(path, input_dict)
      >     os.remove(path)
      >     return output_dict


    '''
def saveImageDataToFile(*args) -> None:
    '''

    hou.saveImageDataToFile

    Create an image file from color and alpha pixel data.

    USAGE
      saveImageDataToFile(color_and_alpha_data, width, height, file_name)


    color_and_alpha_data
        Either a sequence of floats or a binary string containing the image
        data. The data must be in interleaved format, meaning that the first
        4 values are the red, green, blue, and alpha (RGBA) values for the
        first pixel, the next 4 are for the second pixel, and so on. The
        first row of pixels in the data corresponds to the top scanline in
        the image.

        The length of this sequence must be width * height * 4.

        If you are writing a .pic file, the file will store 32-bit float
        data if you pass in a sequence of floats and 8-bit unsigned data if
        you pass in a string.

        The binary string data must be a bytes object in Python 3 and a str
        object in Python 2. See HOM binary data for more information.

    width, height
        The width and height of the image to be written.

    file_name
        The name of the output image file to create. Houdini will
        automatically determine which type of file to create based on this
        file\'s extension.

    This function provides two features not provided by other imaging
    libraries:

      * It lets you create files in Houdini\'s .pic format.

      * It lets you save images with 32-bit float data.

    Raises hou.OperationFailed if the data is not the correct size, the
    output file could not be created, or the output file format is not
    supported by Houdini.

    The following example uses the Python imaging library (PIL) to read in a
    file and calls this function to write it out. Using the convertImage
    function below, you can convert any image that can be read by PIL into
    Houdini\'s .pic format.

    > import Image
    > 
    > def convertImage(input_image, output_image):
    >     im = Image.open(input_image)
    >     im.mode != \\"RGBA\\":
    >         raise ValueError(\\"The image must contain alpha information\\")
    >     hou.saveImageDataToFile(im.tostring(), im.size[0], im.size[1], output_image)
    > 
    > convertImage(\\"image.png\\", \\"image.pic\\")

    hou.imageResolution

    Return the resolution of an image in a file.

    USAGE
      imageResolution(image_file_name) -> tuple of int

    Returns the width and height of an image stored in a file.

    Another way to get the resolution of an image is to load it into a file
    cop and retrieve it. For example, this method could be approximately
    implemented as follows:

    > def imageResolution(image_file_name):
    >     file_cop = hou.node(\\"/img/comp1\\").createNode(\\"file\\")
    >     file_cop.setParm(\\"filename1\\", image_file_name)
    >     resolution = (file_cop.xRes(), file_cop.yRes())
    >     file_cop.destroy()
    >     return resolution

    Note, however, that this method is faster than loading the image into
    Houdini and retrieving the resolution because it is much less disk
    intensive. It does not load the image data from disk, and instead only
    loads as much as necessary to retrieve the resolution.

    Raises hou.OperationFailed if the image file does not exist or if it\'s
    not an image file type supported by Houdini.

    The following example retrieves the resolution of the default.pic file
    that ships with Houdini.

    > >>> hou.imageResolution(hou.findFile(\\"pic/default.pic\\"))
    > (512, 512)

      * Do not confuse hou.nodeType() (starts with a lower-case N, a
        function that returns a NodeType object) with NodeType (starts with
        an upper-case N, the class representing node types).

      * If you have a Node reference to a node in the network, you can get
        its type object by calling hou.Node.type.

      * Each node category has a corresponding function to returns its
        corresponding hou.NodeTypeCategory object. For example,
        hou.sopNodeTypeCategory, hou.objNodeTypeCategory,
        hou.lopNodeTypeCategory, and so on.

      * hou.nodeTypeCategories returns a dict mapping category names to
        NodeTypeCategory objects.

      * If you have a category object, hou.nodeTypeCategory.nodeType takes
        the internal name of a node type and returns the corresponding
        hou.NodeType object. hou.NodeTypeCategory.nodeTypes returns a dict
        mapping internal names to hou.NodeType objects.

      * To see the internal name of a node in the network editor, right
        click the node and choose Type Properties. The internal name
        (without the type category) is at the top of the window labelled
        Operator Type.

    EXAMPLES

      > # The following four ways of looking up the copy SOP\'s node type are equivalent:
      > >>> hou.nodeType(\\"Sop/copy\\")
      > <hou.SopNodeType for Sop copy>
      > 
      > >>> hou.nodeType(hou.sopNodeTypeCategory(), \\"copy\\")
      > <hou.SopNodeType for Sop copy>
      > 
      > >>> hou.nodeType(\\"acme::Sop/rocketboots::2.0\\")

    parent node, return the corresponding NodeType object after evaluating
    aliases. Return None if there is no such type with that name.

    USAGE
      preferredNodeType(name, parent_node=None) -> NodeType or None


    name
        The internal name of a node type including the category. To get the
        internal name of any node type in Houdini, right-click a node of
        that type and choose Type properties. The internal name is listed at
        the top of the type properties window beside Operator type. For
        example, the internal name of the Geometry object is geo.

    parent_node
        Optional. The node that will be the parent for this node type.

      copyNodesTo(nodes, destination_node) -> tuple of Nodes

    The nodes to be copied should be a sequence of hou.OpNode objects. The

    This function returns a tuple of hou.OpNode objects corresponding to the

    way, any relative channel references between nodes with the same parent
    will be updated to reflect the copied node location. Batches themselves
    will be copied sequentially. Thus, channel references between nodes with
    different parents will not be updated in copies.

    the destination, the copy will be renamed. Any relative channel
    references to the copy will be updated with the new copy name.

    This function rounds its output to 6 digits after the decimal point,
    just like Hscript's $FF variable does. To disable this rounding, pass
    True for the <full_precision> parameter. Note, though, that because a
    Python float may not be able to precisely represent a floating point
    value, and because Python does not round numbers when it displays them,
    the frame number might end with 9999999999999 or 0000000000001 when you
    print it to the Python shell. When you convert the number to a string,
    though, Python will round the value.

    a smooth curve between the left keyframe's outgoing value and the right
    keyframe's incoming value, using the left's outgoing slope and
    acceleration and the right's incoming slope and acceleration.

    USAGE
      quintic() -> float

    This function is one of the special animation functions that use the
    current playbar time and information in the parameter's keyframes, such
    as in and out values, tangents, acceleration, etc., to evaluate
    themselves. Because the information needed to evaluate these functions
    comes from the keyframes, these functions take few or no parameters.

    Calling this function from outside a parameter's expression will raise a
    hou.NotAvailable exception.

    The curve will be a straight line from the left keyframe's outgoing
    value, and will not match the right keyframe's outgoing value. Unlike
    the hou.matchin() function, the left keyframe's outgoing value can
    differ from its incoming value, so so hou.vmatchin() can produce curves

    The curve will be a straight line ending at the right keyframe's
    incoming value, and will not match the left keyframe's incoming value.
    Unlike the hou.matchout() function, the right keyframe's incoming value
    can differ from its outgoing value, so so hou.vmatchout() can produce

    USAGE
      fileReferences(project_dir_variable=\'HIP\', include_all_refs=true) ->
      tuple of hou.Parm and str tuples

    Returns a sequence of tuples representing all references to external
    files (such as textures, geometry files, and asset libraries) in the
    current scene.

    The first item in each tuple is a hou.Parm object representing the
    parameter containing the file reference, and the second item is the path
    string. (The second item is a convenience; you can get the same string
    by calling Parm.unexpandedString().)

    This can be useful when preflighting, to check that there are no
    references to files outside $HIP.

    inside Houdini\'s install location, for example default.bgeo in a File
    SOP.)


    project_dir_variable
        You can specify the name of an environment variable. If an asset
        path starts with the variable, it will be replaced with a variable
        reference in the path string returned by this function.

        For example, if $JOB is /mnt/projects/ and an asset is in
        /mnt/projects/tool.hda, if you call hou.fileReferences(\\"JOB\\"), it
        will return the path as $JOB/tool.hda.

    include_all_refs
        If this is True, then the function will return all the file

    USAGE
      setContextOptionConfig(option, config)

    Associates a configuration string string with the context option named
    option. This value is saved in the HIP file, similar to the context
    option's default value.

    The string content is interpreted by the built-in Context Option editor
    pane. If a user or studio create their own context option editor UI,
    they can store arbitrary configuration data in this string. However, in
    that case, you should avoid using the built-in editor because it will
    overwrite the string.


    WARNING
        While we provide API for getting and setting a config string, SideFX
        does not consider the actual format of the string, as written by the
        built-in context option editor pane, to be public API. The format
        may change without notice between versions. If you write rely on the
        config strings created by Houdini, you should understand that they
        may stop working someday.

    The current content is a JSON dictionary with the following keys:

    label
    str

    A human-readable label for the context option.

    type
    str

    This controls what type of interface the context option editor shows the
    user for editing the value. It only configures the user interface.
    Anyone can still set the option to any value through scripting.


    text
        A plain text field.

    number
        A text field that expects a number.

    file_path
        A text field with a button to open a file chooser.


        node_path
            A text field with a button to open a node chooser.

    float_slider
        A numeric text field with a slider. Other config keys below control
        the slider range.

    int_slider
        A numeric text field with a slider that snaps to integers. Other
        config keys below control the slider range.

    string_menu
        A pop-up menu that sets the option to a string value. See the
        menu_items key below.

    int_menu
        A pop-up menu that sets the option to an integer value. See the
        menu_items and autovalues keys below.

    py_menu
        A pop-up menu that runs a Python script to generate the menu item
        labels and values. See the menu_source key below.

    checkbox
        A checkbox. Sets the option value to 0 or 1.

    heading
        The option label is displayed as a heading without any editor. You
        can use this to organize the options into categories.

    order
    int

    The order in which the option appears in the editor view. Any time the
    user drag-reorders an option this number is overwritten.

    comment
    str

    A string explaining the purpose of the context option.

    menu_items
    array

    A list of [label_str, value] pairs, used for mene type editor UIs.

    autovalues
    bool

    Whether int_menu type options should use automatically generated values.
    If this is on, the values for the menu items are set to 0, 1, 2, etc.,
    ignoring the value part of the paris in menu_items.

    menu_source
    str

    For a py_menu type option, this is the Python source code for generating
    the menu. If this string is one line (that is, the string contains no
    newline characters), Houdini evaluates it as an expression. If this
    string has multiple lines, Houdini runs it as if it was the body of a
    function, so it should return the menu items. The result should be a
    list of (label_str, value) pairs.

    minimum
    int or float

    The low end of the slider for int_slider and float_slider types.

    min_locked
    bool

    If this is true, the UI doesn't let the user manually enter numbers
    smaller than minimum.

    maximum
    int or float

    The high end of the slider for int_slider and float_slider types.

    max_locked
    bool

    If this is true, the UI doesn't let the user manually enter numbers
    larger than maximum.

    Return True if the specified context option is an automatic option,
    whose value is normally controlled by Houdini rather than set by the

    any other source, it will still be set to a value determined by the
    following rules:


    fend
        The last frame of the global Houdini frame range. Equivalent to
        theFEND global variable.

    finc
        The current playbar step size.

    fps
        The current playbar frames per second (FPS) setting.

    fstart
        The first frame of the global Houdini frame range. Equivalent to

    ropcook
        An integer value that will be 1 while a ROP node is running,
        otherwise 0.

    ropend
        The last frame of the range being evaluated by the currently cooking
        ROP node. If no ROP node is cooking, it will be equal to the fend
        automatic option.

    ropinc
        The increment value of the frame range being evaluated by the
        currently cooking ROP node. If no ROP node is cooking, it will be
        equal to the finc automatic option.

    ropname
        A string set to the name of the ROP node that is currently running,
        otherwise an empty string.

    roppath
        A string set to the full path of the ROP node that is currently

        client requested /opdef/geo/foo.bgeo and you have a dynamic handler
        for /opdef/geo, the server would use the handler instead of using
        the opdef handler.

        This might be useful if you need a few dynamically generated opdef
        handlers mixed in with the static opdef handler. However, it\'s
        usually best to avoid the confusion and keep opdef resources
        separate from dynamic resources, such as by using the default /opdef
        prefix for opdef section requests.

    hou.videoEncoders

    Returns the video encoders that are registered with a given driver and
    optionally, which encoders are available on the current platform and
    license type.

    USAGE
      videoEncoders(driver, available) -> tuple of str

    The driver parameter must be a hou.videoDriver. If available is True,
    only the encoders that are available on the current platform and license
    type are returned, otherwise all encoders are returned. If it is not
    specified, it is interpreted as False.
