"""A demonstration of how to add to variant sets at different levels of pipeline.

There is an asset that gets added to a "sequence" and then the sequence
is further further refined by a shot. This is shown by adding variant
sets at each step.

Important:
    All of the Stages here are created in-memory to avoid writing to
    disk. Because of that, we use identifiers to refer to those Stages.
    In production code, these identifiers should actually be paths to
    files or some kind of URI that USD can resolve into a consumable
    resource.
