# CG Stubs

## Python stubs for VFX and Animation

These stubs are intended to be used with a type checker like [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to provide [static type checking](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/) of python code, as well as analysis and completion in IDEs like PyCharm and VSCode with Pylance.

Supported libraries and applications:

- [USD](https://pypi.org/project/types-usd/)
- [houdini](https://pypi.org/project/types-houdini/)
- [katana](https://pypi.org/project/types-katana/)
- [mari](https://pypi.org/project/types-mari/)
- [nuke](https://pypi.org/project/types-nuke/)
- [opencolorio](https://pypi.org/project/types-opencolorio/)
- [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/types-PySide2/)
- [substance_painter](https://pypi.org/project/types-substance_painter/)

Note that [pymel](https://pypi.org/project/pymel/) now has very excellent stubs included (more info [here](https://dev.to/chadrik/pymels-new-type-stubs-2die)). 

## Installing

These are distributed as "stubs-only" python packages, so you can just `pip install` whichever packages you need:

```
pip install types-usd types-houdini types-katana types-mari types-nuke types-opencolorio types-PySide2 types-substance_painter
```

## Generating the stubs

You only need to do this if your goal is to help improve the stubs. Otherwise, just use `pip`, as explained above.

Building the stubs requires python 3.9 or greater:

In the instructions below, replace ocio with your desired package to generate.

First, look at `<pkgname>/stubgen_<pkgname>.sh` to see if there are any env vars to set in the `# Custom variables` section.
Next, build the stubs using [`nox`](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/index.html).

```
cd cg-stubs
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r nox-requirements.txt
nox -s 'generate(ocio)'
```

If this fails, here's a more foolproof approach:

```
unset PYTHONPATH
python3.9 -m venv .venv39
. .venv39/bin/activate
python3.9 -m pip install -r nox-requirements.txt
rm -rf .nox
python3.9 -m nox -s 'generate(ocio)'
```

Alternately, you can globally install `nox` using [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

```commandline
pipx install nox
```

### Testing while Developing

The easiest way to use the stubs while you're devleoping them is to create an editable install.  Simply create a `.pth` file in the site-packages directory of the venv where your other deps live:

```
echo "/path/to/cg-stubs/ocio/stubs/" > /path/to/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ocio.pth
```

The name of the .pth file does not matter.  Note that if you're using the mypy daemon, be sure to run `dmypy stop` to reread freshly modified stubs.

### Generating the USD stubs

The USD stubs currently require you to build a special fork of USD, until the necessary changes are merged.

```
git clone https://github.com/chadrik/USD
git checkout doc-stubs2
python3.9 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install PySide6 PyOpenGL
python3.9 build_scripts/build_usd.py --python-docs --docs .build-23.08-py39
```

Then update the variables in `stubgen_usd.sh` and generate as normal.

### Generating the Substance Painter stubs

These must be generated from within the UI, because I could not figure out how to run a standlone interpreter.

```
import mypy.stubgen;mypy.stubgen.main(['-p', '_substance_painter'])
```

Then generate as normal to cleanup the stubs.

### Generating the Houdini stubs

The Houdini stubs currently use a completely different approach to building which will eventually be ported to `nox`.  So this may be unapproachable for most users for now.


## Publishing to PyPI

To publish to pypi.org, first run the nox installation steps from the Generating section, then run the `publish` task (replacing ocio with the package to publish):

```
nox -s 'publish(ocio)'
```

To publish to a custom registry:

```
poetry config repositories.pypi-nexus https://nexus.myorg/repository/pypi/
nox -s 'publish(ocio)' --  --repository pypi-nexus -u pypi -p 'whatever'
```
